### Notes:

- Need Right to Repair, and specialists that can come out and help fix farm equipment.
- Need doctor hiring program
- Need rural doctors and educators desperately
- Abolish religious schools
- Need to build more schools and hospitals
- Need to reinvest in LTC and personal care homes
- Personal care homes need to be public, not private. 
- NDDVA and NHSOA will be folded into SaskHealth 
- Expansion of Public Education is a must. From k-12 and university. It must all be free and high quality and easily accessible everywhere. Thats where SaskDLC comes in. 
- Need to think about population growth and degrowth. Like will we need as many schools as we have now? Like towns are shrinking
- Digital Nomad / Digital Worker stuff? 
- Need to add Human Dignity to [[The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code|The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code]] 
	- looks more like human dignity already is there, but I could make it more explicit for sure. More like Germany in that we explicitly say Human Dignity is inviolable and it is the duty of the state to uphold it. And ALSO!!!!! must codify rights like right to abortion services / bodily autonomy, transgender rights and autonomy, and etc. 
- THIS WILL ACTUALLY BE A COLLECTIONS OF DIFFERENT ACTS. One for each institution and then other things from the [[21st Century Act (21CA)]] like Human Dignity. 
- [[Saskatchewan Government Insurance (SGI)]] should insure housing and rental / tenant insurance. They should also give better rates for homes that are more climate resilient !!!!



- "We've always done things ourselves here in Saskatchewan. When big business dont deem us profitable enough we do things ourselves."
