### Main Idea:

*(Explain the idea in your own words, as if you were explaining it to a friend. How does it work? Why is it important? What are its implications? This is where you do your thinking.)*

### [[Saskatchewan Agriculture Board (SAB)]]

- Fair Market Floor
	- A standing bid for key crops each week saying they will buy X tonnes at $Y, next tranche @  $Y − $Δ)
	- A guaranteed minimum price for key Saskatchewan crops at the start of each season.
	- Runs forward contracts pre-season with guaranteed minimums + upside sharing (if market clears higher farmers get a % of that upside)
- Reference Price 
	- The weekly provincial average elevator bid for grade/spec X at delivery point Y, collected from licensed buyers and published by SAB. 
	- If the reference price < the announced floor price SAB shall pay a deficiency equal to the floor price - reference price on delivered volume 
	- All licensed primary buyers must file daily posted bids by grade/spec and deliever point to SAB. 
		- SAB publishes a weekly provincial Reference Price as the weighted average of those bids
		- Individual buyer data is confidential
		- Non filing or false filing subject to AMPs
- Voluntary Pools
	- Like a modernized Wheat Board, but this time Farmers opt-in. 
	- SAB aggregates, hedges, times sales, and pays pooled returns + interim advances
	- Pool interim/final returns vs benchmarks published each season. 
	- Publish pool rules 
		- pre-season (fees, hedge policy, delivery windows)
		- mid-season interim
		- Final pool statements benchmarked to futures basis. 
- Administers the Regenerative Dividend
	- A per-acre cash payment to any farmer who adopts and maintains certified regenerative agricultural practices.
	- Tiered per-acre payments for documented practiced (no till + cover, diverse rotation, managed grazing/trees) 
	- Three year contracts
	- Remote sensing + random soil audits for compliance 
- Fast Payments / Grading Dispute
	- SAB and licensed buyers must pay within 7 days of delivery. Grading disputes go to an expedited SAB adjudicator within 10 days, decisions are binding, subject to appeal. 
	- Either party in a Grading dispute can go to third party lab for assays on request.
- Resells via transparent auction to mills/processors/exporters and, most importantly, Sask Grocery and SAB Wholesale. 
- Manages risk 
	- Hedging on futures/FX, diversifying off take contracts, position limits
	- Independent Risk Committee sets position limits / VaR / Stop Loss, with quarterly public reporting on positions, hedges, realized margins
	- Two pockets for capital
		- Safety net paid by appropriation
		- Commercial activity funded by facility / Sask Bonds.
	- Borrowing limit for SAB set by regulation
	- Quarterly position report (net tonnes by crop, VaR, realized margins.)
	- Auditor General to audit both Safety Net and Commercial annually. 
- Safety Net / Risk Mitigation
	- If the published weekly price of the Reference Price is below the pre-announced floor, SAB pays farmers the difference as a cheque, the grain still sells to whoever the farmer chooses
	- Deficiency payments are production-neutral income stabilization, not contingent on export nor volume delivered to SAB.
	- If no one buys at/near floor, SAB buys limited tonnages and moves it through its commercial arm. 
- SAB Wholesale
	- Must offer same landed wholesale price and logistics tariffs to eligible Saskatchewan independents and co-ops (with certain amount of locations in the province), published publicly. 
	- Large national chains are not eligible. 
	- Local Farms can sell to Wholesale or through wholesale. 
- Any farmland, routing, storage, water use, or extraction on or affecting Indigenous Lands requires FPIC and benefit agreements (jobs, revenue share, procurement)
- Supplier retaliation prohibited for selling to SAB / SaskGrocery
- No sale of customer purchase data
