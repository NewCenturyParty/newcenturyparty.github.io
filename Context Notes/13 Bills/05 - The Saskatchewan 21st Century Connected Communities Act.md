### Main Idea:

We aren't just building houses, nor just rebuilding a bus line. We are building strong, healthy, communities and connecting them. 

--- 

### Purpose

- Connect people, good, services, heat, and internet across the province. 
- Reduce travel / energy burden
- Ensure FPIC and complete [[Consent Protocol]] is achieved when Indigenous right/lands are affected in anyway 

### [[21st Century Cities Accord (21CCA)]]

- Walkable Living (outcomes based goal of achieving within 5 years)
	- Coverage targets

	- By Right approvals inside PHZ if objective rules are met 
		- Height/FAR,
		- setbacks, 
		- frontage, 
		- [[Century Codes]] Compliance, 
		- universal design from Sask Design Book
- [[Century Codes]]
	- Net-Zero Readiness / climate resilience (e.g., super-insulation, reversible heat pump / AC Units, passive cooling);
	- Clean, healthy indoor air, to be ‘pandemic and wildfire smoke ready’ (e.g., visible and accessible CO2 Monitors for each room, MERV13+ and/or HEPA filtration for each room, at least 15+ Air Changes per Hour (ACH) for each room);
	- Universal Accessibility (e.g., for those in wheelchairs, walkers, braille and alarms for the blind etc.);
	- Decentralized energy options (e.g., solar panels and batteries for them);
	- Abundant sources of natural lighting, and healthy indoor lighting;
	- Safe building materials with material passports, (e.g., fire-resistant, non-toxic, sustainable and recyclable materials);
	- Efficient use of water, with grey-water recycling;
	- Integration of open-source smart or assistive technology with privacy at the heart of its design;
	- Accessible wiring as to be easily replaced or upgraded for future innovations;

### [[Saskatchewan Transport Corporation (STC)]] 

- No longer just a transit company, but a logistics and transport company that also does transit. 
- FPIC 
	- [[Consent Protocol]] by the affected nation and [[Saskatchewan Council for Reconciliation (SCR)]] (all from [[02 - The Saskatchewan Reconciliation and Treaty Renewal Act]]) required for all routes and land usage that crosses or is on Indigenous Lands. 
- Mandate of buses on the ground within 18 months.

		- Feasibility study on both options must be completed within 3 months.
- Depots
	- Built within communities for easy access, parking
	- Designed with cold storage capacity. 
	- Pick up and drop off between Depots
		- Almost like a personal mail service???? except just between local depots, not door to door. 
	- MAYBE THESE WILL BECOME SASKGROCERY SUPERMARKETS at the same time???????? Will need feasibility study but why not combine them????? A WAY TO GET FRESH GROCERIES, PARCELS, AND TRANSIT ALL IN ONE SOUNDS PRETTY DOPE THOOOOOOOO
- Customers

- Expand Public Wifi areas and also to more than just SaskTel Customers
	- High enough speeds and bandwidth to be useable by many 
	- Free
	- Never tracks or collects data
	- Private by default

 
 

- Co-trenching / coordinate with [[Saskatchewan Energy (SaskEnergy)]] and [[Saskatchewan Power (SaskPower)]], cities and their ambient loops and energy works with a "Dig Once" Policy as to not disrupt communities more than necessary 



### [[Saskatchewan Government Insurance (SGI)]]

- SGI will expand and promote its home insurance offerings 
- Discount levels for Century Code Compliance rate
- Renters insurance

### Notes: 


- This will talk about how we connect our communities together via a new [[Saskatchewan Transport Corporation (STC)]] which is both a freight / transport company and a bus company. It will connect the province and supply it at the same time. It will be how we get groceries shipped around and packages and medical supplies and so on. 

- This will also talk about the [[Saskatchewan Transport Corporation (STC)]]'s goal for the [[Saskatchewan High Speed Rail Line]] that starts by connecting Regina to Saskatoon, with plans to connect other cities immediately afterward. 

- This will talk about [[Saskatchewan Housing Corporation (SHC)]] buying socialized housing units from [[Saskatchewan Manufacturing Corporation (SMC)]]. They will follow [[Century Codes]]. They will be built rapidly and at scale and placed absolutley everywhere. It will revitalize and transform rural communities and build strong connected neighbourhoods in cities. 

- This will talk about new renter protections. 

- This will talk about new Provincial incentives and changes to Municipality law to allow and promote the switch from Property Taxes to Land Value Taxes and for the abolishment of Single Family Zoning. 

- This will talk about [[21st Century Neighbourhoods]] and Cities with integrated neighbourhoods and services anchored by a [[Saskatchewan Grocery (SaskGrocery)]] store. They must be walkable, not care centric. There must be charging stations for e-cars and e-bikes. There must be bike paths everywhere, given priority over cars. Think European style. There must also be a SaskLibrary. It must be easily accessible for all, no matter their abilities. The [[Saskatchewan Transport Corporation (STC)]] need to be able to get around and move people though too. 

- This will talk about how [[Saskatchewan Government Insurance (SGI)]] will now do renter and home insurance in the province and will tie insurance rates to things like climate resilience. So if you have modern insulation your home will get insured for less, if you have solar panels you will pay less insurance, and so on. SGI will also give discounts on car insurance to EVs

- This will enact an EV tax rebate in Sask similar to other provinces. 

- [[Saskatchewan Power (SaskPower)]] will be instructed to put EV / ebike charging stations everywhere, and they are either free, or very very low cost. 

- As part of the [[10 - The Saskatchewan Digital Sovereignty Act]], [[Saskatchewan Telecommunications (SaskTel)]] will finalize and complete the goal of getting high speed fibre internet to everyone, everywhere, in the province.
