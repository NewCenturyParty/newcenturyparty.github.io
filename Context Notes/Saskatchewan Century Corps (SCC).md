### Notes:

- Public Option for employ for things the province needs doing
- Might just limit it to environment, care, infrastructure, and maybe agriculture, for now. All of them must be trained for disaster response though. 
- One Year of Service = One Tuition Voucher 
- Need to allow for journeyman growth and achievement
