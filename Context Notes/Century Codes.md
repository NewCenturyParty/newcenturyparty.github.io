### Main Idea:

### Notes:


-  ‘Century Codes’ means the new building codes established by Century Homes, as detailed under Part IV of this Act. The aim of such codes is to exceed current national standards to meet the standards required for the 21st Century. These new codes and regulations shall at minimum promote:
	-  Net-Zero Readiness / climate resilience (e.g., super-insulation, reversible heat pump / AC Units, passive cooling);
	-  Clean, healthy indoor air, to be ‘pandemic and wildfire smoke ready’ (e.g., visible and accessible CO2 Monitors for each room, MERV13+ and/or HEPA filtration for each room, at least 15+ Air Changes per Hour (ACH) for each room);
	-  Universal Accessibility (e.g., for those in wheelchairs, walkers, braille and alarms for the blind etc.);
	-  Decentralized energy options (e.g., solar panels and batteries for them);
	- Abundant sources of natural lighting, and healthy indoor lighting;
	-  Safe building materials with material passports, (e.g., fire-resistant, non-toxic, sustainable and recyclable materials);
	-  Efficient use of water, with grey-water recycling;
	-  Integration of open-source smart or assistive technology with privacy at the heart of its design;
	- Accessible wiring as to be easily replaced or upgraded for future innovations;
	- Passive design;
	- Biophilic design; and
	-  Acoustic comfort.
