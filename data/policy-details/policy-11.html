<h3>The Problem</h3>

    <p>
        There is an unemployment crisis and also a worker shortage. 
    </p>

<h3>The Promise</h3>

    <p>
        The NCP will hire, build, and train the workforce of tomorrow, by doing the work of today. 
    </p>

<h3>The Plan</h3>

    <p>
        The NCP, through direct partnership and discussion with the unions of Saskatchewan, will introduce The Saskatchewan Century Corps Act.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Act will introduce a new Crown corporation to be known as the Saskatchewan Century Corps (SCC). The SCC will be the Employer of Record (EoR), mandated to employ and train workers in priority sectors. The SCC will be open to all, no matter the ability. There will be streamlined on-ramps, including accessibility employment tracks, with extra supports and modified expectations for those who want to serve but need extra help to serve their province. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The SCC shall act as a pre-apprenticeship feeder program, with all hours worked on certified job sites counting toward official trade qualifications under existing union agreements. It acts as a "merge lane" or a "training hospital" for the new economy. It will deliver both paid, on the job training, as well as in the classroom training, each week that leads to recognized credentials.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See Policy 09 - Fair Labour for more.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        The work done by SCC employees is provided through Standing Master Agreements. The Government of Saskatchewan, through its Crowns, Ministries, and Agencies, will provide these agreements and contracts to the SCC for work in needed, relevant, areas. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Initial Standing Master Agreements will be established with SaskEnergy (ambient loop installation), SaskPower (grid modernization), SaskTel (fibre deployment), Saskatchewan Housing Corporation (SaskHomes construction), Saskatchewan Health Authority (care workforce), and the Ministry of Environment (site remediation).
    </p>
    <p>
        The SCC will have Public Rate Cards, updated and posted regularly. To ensure that the SCC will not underbid qualified bidders. The SCC will not underbid qualified contractors who meet or exceed SCC wage and benefit standards. Where no bidder meets these standards, the SCC may bid to ensure work is performed at fair wages. The SCC will never be the sole permitted bidder on any contract.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where feasible, secondments and subcontracts will be used. Priority will be given to secondments and subcontracts with public entities, non-profits, and co-ops, and private firms where it supports training, apprenticeships, and local capacity. 
    </p>
    <p>
        All credentialing for designated trades within the SCC shall be governed by a council with majority representation from the relevant provincial trade unions, as appointed by the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. The SCC will arrange and pay for training and verified hours during the working loop. Some SCC supervisors will be approved as assessors / validators by the relevant credentialing bodies so they may sign off on hours and competencies. 
    </p>
    <p>
        SCC employment in relevant streams counts toward Century Apprenticeship Program hours. Workers who complete sufficient hours and pass assessments may earn Century Certified credentials while employed by the SCC.
    </p>

        </ul>
    <p>
        Energy Veterans who choose the Redeploy pathway may enter the SCC at advanced standing, with their industry experience recognized through Prior Learning Assessment. Energy Veterans in the SCC receive all standard SCC benefits plus their Energy Veterans entitlements (bonus, Debt Shield, pension parity).
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See Policy 10 - Energy Veterans for more.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        All SCC remote deployments must strictly adhere to prevailing union-scale per diems, and all travel time to and from remote sites shall be paid at the standard hourly rate. The SCC will be mandated to maintain COR/ISO equivalent safety programs, and OHS representatives must be on the Board.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SCC will maintain equity targets to ensure participation reflects Saskatchewan's diversity. Initial targets: 50% women across all streams, 20% Indigenous workers, 15% workers with disabilities, 25% workers from rural and northern communities, 30% workers under age 26. Targets will be reviewed annually and adjusted based on outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Free, Prior, and Informed Consent must be achieved for any and all projects affecting Indigenous lands, waters, communities, or cultures. 
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See Policy 04 - Reconciliation for more.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        <strong><u>The Compensation:</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Employees begin paid employment from day one, including the bootcamp and all training. No SCC employee will be paid less than $30 per hour, with higher scales in skilled occupations. Target pay will be at or above the median wage for comparable work in the sector the SCC employee works in. Premiums will be granted for:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rural / Northern placements</li>

            <li>Speaking an Indigenous language</li>
            <li>Hard to staff positions and roles</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        <strong><u>Initial Corps Streams:</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The initial streams of the SCC will be:
    </p>
        <ul>
           <li>The Saskatchewan Operations and Logistics (O&L) Corps.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Potential Roles: STC depot operations, provincial warehouse management, fleet maintenance support.</li>
                </ul>
           <li>The Saskatchewan Environmental and Resilience (E&R) Corps.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Potential Roles: Site remediation, reforestation, FireSmart fuel breaks, flood preparation.</li>
                </ul>
           <li>The Saskatchewan Care and Community (C&C) Corps.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Potential Roles: Home care support, childcare assistance, community program delivery.</li>
                </ul>
           <li>The Saskatchewan Infrastructure and Housing (I&H) Corps.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Potential Roles: SaskHomes construction, public housing renovation, municipal infrastructure.</li>
                </ul>
           <li>The Saskatchewan Digital and Tech (D&T) Corps.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Potential Roles: SaskStack development, digital service delivery, IT support for government.</li>
                </ul>
           <li>The Saskatchewan Agriculture and Aquaculture (A&A) Corps.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Potential Roles: Crown land stewardship, aquaculture facility support, agricultural research stations.</li>
                 </ul>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Work will be categorized and distributed through these streams. To reiterate: the unions will be in charge of creating the curriculum and work plans. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There will also be an option to become an Emergency Reservist will be offered to SCC employees. It will be strictly Opt-in. These reservists would be given extra training and pay for disaster response. They would then be deployable on declared provincial emergencies. Two paid re-training days a year will be mandatory to stop any skill atrophy. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>The Loop:</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        SCC employees work a 30-hour week. The standard schedule is five 6-hour days: three days on job sites, two days in classroom or lab settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        SCC employees will go through a loop of employment each year. The loop will start with a Bootcamp of 6 weeks. During this Bootcamp employees will learn all the regular trainings mosts jobs require. Things like CPR, First Aid, WHMIS, and more. After that, employees will be given more specific training on how to do their specific job placement. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Following the six-week bootcamp, employees enter the Work/Learn cycle for the remainder of the year. Annual reviews occur on the anniversary of each employee's start date.   
    </p>
    <p>
        The Work/Learn cycle is where 3 days of the week will be on a job site, actively working. 2 days of the week are in the lab or classroom for specific instruction, actively learning, and completing credentialed exams. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Each year the employee will go through an annual review. The SCC will assess how satisfied and happy the employee is in their role and its trajectory, and how well they've done in their work. The employee will choose how they want to go forward each year of employment. They may either:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Continue in the SCC, in the same stream</li>
            <li>Continue in the SCC, in a different stream</li>
            <li>Transition to private sector employment (with SaskJobs support)</li>
            <li>Use their Tuition Vouchers for formal education</li>
            <li>Gain promotion within SCC (become a supervisor/mentor)</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Workers who do not meet performance standards will receive additional support and, if needed, reassignment to a different stream. Workers who cannot succeed after reasonable accommodation may be separated from the SCC with full Career Navigator support from SaskJobs to find alternative employment.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>Tuition Vouchers:</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        For every year of honourable service in the SCC, employees will earn a Tuition Voucher. This Voucher will cover the cost of one full academic year at any public University or Trade school in Saskatchewan, including books, bus passes, and any other fees.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tuition Vouchers will be designed as a non-taxable education grant under federal tax law. They will have no expiration date, but cannot be transferred to others. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Tuition Vouchers can be used to pay off existing student loan debt, federal or provincial by payment to the NSLSC. Tuition value will be capped by new agreements with public education institutions and unions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>Governance and Union:</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The first order of business of the SCC will be to decide if the SCC will either make its own union or fold itself into the SGEU. The decision will be made in consultation with the Ministry and SGEU to do whatever is best for the employees. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A CEO will be appointed to serve at the pleasure of the Board with Minister concurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Board must include representation from:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Indigenous governing bodies and organizations.</li>
            <li>Labour Unions</li>
            <li>Municipalities</li>
            <li>Crowns/Ministries (SaskPower, SaskEnergy, SaskTel)</li>
            <li>Education Partners (The Universities and Sask Polytech)</li>
            <li>Safety and OHS</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Dashboards will be created and updated weekly to provide stats on  SCC work progress, ensuring complete transparency. 
    </p>
   
<h3>The Funding</h3>

    <p>
        The vast majority of funding will come from the General Revenue Fund, with contract revenue returning to the GRF.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overtime, SCC contract revenue and productivity gains in other Crowns and Ministries will partially offset its operating costs. 
    </p>

<h3>What It Means For You</h3>

    <p>
        It means building something real and meaningful.
    </p>
    <p>
        It means no more desperate job searches.
    </p>
    <p>
        It means the dignity of building your community.
