    <h3>The Problem</h3>
        
        <p>
            Human Dignity has fallen off to the way side of provincial concerns, dropping so far as to attack the inherent dignity and rights of the most vulnerable children in our province. We cannot move forward if we are stuck in old ways of thinking.
        </p>

    <h3>The Promise</h3>
        
        <p>
            An NCP Government will not just simply promise uphold Human Dignity, rather it will bind itself by law so that the primary duty of any Government of Saskatchewan is first and foremost to respect, protect, and uphold Human Dignity. 
        </p>

    <h3>The Plan</h3>
        
        <p>
            The NCP will put forward The Saskatchewan Human Dignity Act. This Act will make three binding proclamations that will be the fiduciary duty of all governmental action going forward. 
        </p>
            <ol class="policy-detail__list">
                <li>Human Dignity is inherent and inviolable.</li>
                <li>The primary duty of all provincial authority is to respect, protect, and uphold Human Dignity.</li>
                <li>Indignity can never excuse further indignity.</li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            The Act will state that all other enactments and decisions shall, to the extent possible, be ready consistently with this Act. Any later Acts intending to limit or change these declarations must clearly and expressly say so. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Act will empower The Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission with the funding and authority to investigate claims of breached dignity by, and issue binding recommendations to, the Government of Saskatchewan. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Act will state that anyone who claims serious, demonstrable, harm to their dignity, by act or omission of the province, may appeal to this newly empowered Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If satisfaction still cannot be reached a person may apply for the Court of Kings Bench for relief, after all ordinary appeals and attempts at satisfaction are exhausted. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Corporations and other private entities are will be explicitly exempted from the dignity protections.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Human Rights Code shall be amended to ensure its interpretation is made specifically to uphold and protect the inherent dignity of all as well as include and strengthen protections based on:
        </p>
            <ul class="policy-detail__list">
                <li>Neurodiversity</li>
                <li>Gender Identity and Expression</li>
                <li>Any Physical or Mental Disability</li>
                <li>Social Condition</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Source of Income</li>
                        <li>Employment Status</li>
                        <li>Housing Status</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>

    <h3>The Funding</h3>
    
        <p>
            CCapacity funding will be granted from the General Revenue Fund so that experts in Ethics and Human Rights Law can write the Saskatchewan Human Dignity Act to expertly bind the Government of Saskatchewan into respecting, upholding, and protecting Human Dignity for all.
        </p>

    <h3>What It Means For You</h3>
    
        <p>
           It means by law your government must respect you. 
        </p>
        <p>
           It means no matter what, your dignity is your right. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It means meeting the expectations of the 21st Century.
