<h3>The Problem</h3>

    <p>
        Education is underfunded, overburdened, under-appreciated, and built for the last century.
    </p>

<h3>The Promise</h3>

    <p>
        The NCP will create the best environment for education in the country by funding our education system like never before and ensure that it grows to meet the needs of residents no matter their stage of life.
    </p>

<h3>The Plan</h3>

    <p>
        The NCP will introduce several bills in a Lifelong Learning Package.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will treat our educators with the respect and reverence that they deserve. Either immediately, or come next contract, in good faith negotiations with the STF, the Government will offer the following:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A $15,000 bonus to be given to current, new, and any returning staff. </li>
            <li>A 25% increase to all wage bands.</li>
            <li>Extra premiums for:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Staff in rural and northern communities</li>
                    <li>Classrooms with over the negotiated class cap</li>
                    <li>Students with complex needs</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    <p>
        An Educator Recruitment Initiative will provide relocation support, and student loan forgiveness for educators or student educators who commit to teaching anywhere in Saskatchewan. Extra grants and tax incentives will be given to any educator who commits to teaching in underserved communities for a minimum of three years.
    </p>
    <p>
        Universal, publicly-funded pre-kindergarten will be available to all four-year-olds, with priority expansion to communities currently lacking early childhood education options.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>K-12</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Per-student funding will be increased to be the highest in Canada, starting at $25,000 per student, indexed to Saskatchewan's CPI inflation annually. Additional student funding will be granted for weighted needs, such as rural, complexity, ELA, and disabilities. This will include free breakfast and lunches provided by the schools. Additional grants will be given to ensure every school can provide free healthy meals. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Student transportation funding will be provided separately from per-student funding, ensuring rural and remote students have reliable access to schools regardless of distance.
    </p>
    <p>
        First Nations-operated schools will be eligible for provincial funding top-ups to ensure per-student funding parity with provincial schools, in addition to federal education transfers, where requested by the governing First Nation.
    </p>
    <p>
        No educator will be left behind. Education Assistants and support staff will receive dedicated statutory funding based on school size and staffing ratios established through binding agreement with the Saskatchewan Teacher's Federation (STF). There will also be new trainings and rules around student behaviours as to protect our educators and students with mandatory external safety audits for violent incidents. Work refusals for unsafe classrooms are explicitly protected under the new Fair Work Authority.
    </p>
    <p>
        Students with complex learning, behavioural, or physical needs will receive individualized support plans developed with families, educators, and specialists. Funding will follow the student, ensuring supports are available regardless of which school they attend.
    </p>
    <p>
        A new statutory school supplies grant will be given to schools to ensure each classroom has the supplies they need for class work and classroom decoration. No longer will teachers be expected to pay out of pocket. 
    </p>
    <p>
        New increased minimum prep times will be introduced with guaranteed hours based on class sizes and grade.
    </p>
    <p>
        Class sizes will be capped and reduced so that educators can give adequate attention and support to all their students. The specific class sizes and staffing ratios will be established through binding agreement with the STF.
    </p>
    <p>
        Extra Curricular Activities, especially those outside of school hours, will receive new and increased funding that includes educator pay for presiding over such activities. Educators must be fairly compensated for any extra curricular work. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Arts programs will receive new and additional funding to ensure students have access to, and education as a necessary part of the human experience and the expression of Saskatchewan. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Educators will be offered new bursaries to expand their knowledge and teaching abilities in the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Indigenous history, culture, and languages.</li>
                <li>Special education and supporting students with complex needs.</li>
                <li>New curriculum subjects.</li>
                <li>Trauma informed teaching practices.</li>
                <li>Anti-racism and anti-oppression education.</li>
                <li>French.</li>
                <li>English as a Second Language.</li>
                <li>and more.</li>
            </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Police in residence will be replaced with Indigenous Elders in residence, should any Elders consent. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Attendance increase schemes or avoidance deterrence will be banned. Children will not be punished for not being able to attend school. Instead new supports and training will be provided to help students, educators, and parents determine the cause of attendance failures. The focus is on fixing the problem, not the child. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Public funding for private and independent schools will be phased out over five years, declining by 20% annually. Students enrolled in private schools at the time this Act comes into force may complete their current level of schooling (elementary or secondary) with proportional funding support.
    </p>
    <p>
        Catholic schools, as constitutionally protected separate schools, will continue to receive public funding. However, they must teach the provincial curriculum, follow provincial labor standards, and may not discriminate against students or staff on any Human Rights Code protected ground.
    </p>
    <p>
        Home Schooling will have new restrictions and rules:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Educators must register and get a free license from the province in order to homeschool.</li>
            <li>Educators must submit background checks to the province.</li>
            <li>Educators must submit annual learning and curricula plans to the Ministry, following the provincial curriculum.</li>
            <li>Students and Educators must meet with Ministry of Education representatives for a biannual portfolio review.</li>
            <li>Students must be enrolled, for free, in the Saskatchewan Distance Learning Centre.
            <ul>
                <li>Grants will be provided for devices as well as internet and electricity bills.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Students must complete an annual standardized test for their grade level to ensure accountability and quality of education.</li>
            <li>Enforcement will prioritize support over punishment and escalate slowly. The goal is to support quality learning and the child, not punish the parents.</li>
        </ul>    
    <p>
        <strong><u>New Curriculum:</u></strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        The Government will work in partnership with Indigenous nations, governing bodies, and organizations, as well as the universities and trades schools in Saskatchewan, to design an updated and modern provincial education curriculum for k-12. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The curriculum will be outcomes based, without new or additional standardized testing. The goal is not to create more work for the teachers, but to make their work more meaningful.
    </p>
    <p>
        Suggested new subjects, to be taught alongside existing subjects as to not overwhelm teachers, include:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Civic and Labour History.</li>
            <li>Media and Digital Literacy.</li>
            <li>Critical Thinking outside of just English Class.</li>
            <li>Financial Literacy.</li>
            <li>Consent and Healthy Relationships.</li>
            <li>Climate and Land-based Learning.</li>
            <li>Reconciliation and Treaties.</li>
            <li>Indigenous Languages.</li>
        </ul>
        </ul>
    <p>
        <strong><u>Post Secondary:</u></strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Statutory, multi-year funding agreements will be made to ensure post secondary institutions have reliable and predictable funding. A floor to stand on.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additional operating grants will be set to clear benchmarks around inflation, enrolment growth, population, and agreed upon program expansions. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Tuition will be capped so that it can only increase annually by Saskatchewan's CPI inflation plus 1.5% or other small margin determined in partnership with post secondary sector partners.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tuition Vouchers, which cover tuition, fees, books, etc, must be redeemable by the post secondary institution in order to receive any other funding by the province. Redemption of vouchers will be dependent on seat availability in the selected program each year. If a program is at capacity, voucher holders may defer redemption to the following intake, apply to a related program, or request placement on a priority waitlist. Vouchers do not expire due to program capacity constraints.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See Policy 11 - The Saskatchewan Century Corps for more.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Crowns and Ministries will partner with post secondary institutions for training, as well as long-term research on the various new initiatives taken on by the Government of Saskatchewan. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A Capacity Expansion Fund will be created. The funding will be tied to that year's demand from SCC Tuition Vouchers and Energy Veterans retraining, and overall labour market metrics. For example, with every 100 Tuition Vouchers redeemed in a program area, the Capacity Expansion Fund will provide funding for one additional faculty position and proportional facility expansion in that area up to the institution's physical capacity. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The Capacity Expansion Fund will fund:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>New faculty lines in high-demand programs.</li>
            <li>More clinical instructors in nursing and allied health programs.</li>
            <li>More lab and shop space for trades and applied programs.</li>
            <li>Instructional design staff for SaskDLC and other hybrid programs.</li>
            <li>New research funding.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        The post secondary institutions in Saskatchewan will also be eligible for grants to do public research in Saskatchewan's interest. The Saskatchewan Advanced Research Projects Agency (SARPA) will be established to handle these research initiatives. Exact details will be made in partnership with the post secondary institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>The Saskatchewan Library Authority (SLA):</u></strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        A new, federated, opt-in group for all libraries in Saskatchewan will be established and known as the Saskatchewan Library Authority. For SLA participating libraries, there will be a single, unified Library Card under a unified catalogue province wide.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participating libraries must agree to a code of Intellectual Freedom in their collections, meaning no removals or omissions based on viewpoint. The selection criteria must be transparent. Shelving, both physical and digital, must be age appropriate. Materials and works where AI-generated content is the primary creative output are not eligible to be part of the catalogue.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyone challenging a book's inclusion in the SLA must go through a formal review by an independent panel of librarians. The default bias must be that no books should be banned, with exceptions only for material that blatantly violates the criminal code. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Physical book delivery will be managed in partnership with the new Saskatchewan Transport Corporation (STC).
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See Policy 06 - 21st Century Connected Communities for more.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Participating central libraries will receive grants to expand their buildings and services to include maker spaces and equipment lending. They will also receive grants to purchase connected devices for long term rental periods, such as an education semester, with priority given to SaskDLC students. Participating libraries will be prohibited from charging any late fees. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A Saskatchewan Open Library program will be introduced that collects out of print, and public domain materials. Such materials will be stored and operated by the SLA and have no limits on digital lending. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The Government of Saskatchewan will seek Most Favoured Nation terms in publisher negotiations and will prioritize publishers who offer equitable and accessible licensing across Canadian jurisdictions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data generated by the SLA and participating libraries cannot be given or sold to any outside entity of the Government of Saskatchewan. Library users' data will not be used in any training of any form of artificial intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>The Saskatchewan Distance Learning Centre</u></strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        The Saskatchewan Distance Learning Centre (SaskDLC) will receive a new mandate and new funding to expand their services. 
    </p>   
    <p>
        Educators from the STF will be recruited and paid their union wages to help create free, self-paced, Adult Basic Education programs, Adult Literacy programs, High School Upgrading programs, and a self paced K-12 program. All of which must follow the provincial curriculum and thus are eligible for official transcripts. Delivery will be both synchronous and asynchronous for learners to choose their preference, with educators staffed for synchronous delivery of their lessons. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition programs for new comers and residents will be offered for low to no-cost depending on ability to pay. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Tutoring services will be offered to any and all residents using Education Program students in the Universities. These positions would be paid union rates. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The SaskDLC will have a goal of being as accessible as possible with various language options, disability first designs, and human-made subtitles. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Data generated by students, educators, and the SaskDLC is prohibited from being sold, distributed, or used outside the Government of Saskatchewan. Student learning data will be prohibited from being used to train any form of artificial intelligence models.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>Arts Funding:</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Arts are a fundamental part of human life and the province will commit to funding them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Arts funding will be restored to at least $15 per capita annually, with annual increases indexed to CPI.
    </p>
    <p>
        An arms length public arts council will be created to distribute and manage the funds. Creation grants and operating grants will be delivered to various artists, festivals, and tourism divisions doing public works. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A Film and Television Production Tax Credit of 30% of eligible Saskatchewan labor costs will be established, stackable with federal incentives.
    </p>
    <p>
        A minimum of 20% of Arts funding must be spent outside of Regina and Saskatoon, with extra grants given to small towns. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Participating SLA libraries will have regular periodic exhibit spaces for local artists. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Materials and works where AI-generated content is the primary creative output are not eligible for funding.
    </p>

<h3>The Funding</h3>

    <p>
        Education funding shall come out of the General Revenue fund. 
    </p>

<h3>What It Means For You</h3>

    <p>
        It means a quality education no matter your age or ability. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It means our educators get the pay and recognition they deserve. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It means the dignity in always learning. 
    </p>
