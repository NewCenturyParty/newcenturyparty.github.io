<h3>The Problem</h3>

    <p>
        People are living to work, not working to live, and the work is unfair, unsatisfying, and unbalanced.
    </p>

<h3>The Promise</h3>

    <p>
        The NCP will bring labour into the 21st Century through a new Worker Bill of Rights, Apprenticeship reforms, and entities to make sure it sticks.
    </p>

<h3>The Plan</h3>

    <p>
        The NCP will introduce bills that create:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A Workers’ Bill of Rights.</li>
            <li>SaskJobs as an active labour market maker.</li>
            <li>The Fair Work Authority.</li>
            <li>Apprenticeship Expansion.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Together the bills will transform the economy of Saskatchewan to a high-productivity, high-paying, highly rested, economy.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>Workers’ Bill of Rights:</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The bill will be put into law as soon as possible, but the provisions will come into force over the course of four years, allowing for a smooth and orderly transition. This bill will include the following: 
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>The 30 Hour Work Week:</u> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Phased in over a four year term, all provincially regulated sectors will gradually have the legally defined full time hours be reduced from 40 hours per week to 30 hours per week, or 120 hours per month for positions using Alternative Schedule Permits. Part-time work will be considered to be under 30 hours a week. This allows for more flexibility in work and in life. Employers and employees can determine the best schedule for them, be it five days weeks with 6 hour days, four day weeks with 7.5 hour days, or a compresses three day week with 10 hour days. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The move to the 30 hour standard work week will not come with any reduction in employee's weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly base compensation. Employers will be mandated to adjust employee compensation rates upwards to match the expected or previously budgeted annual compensation packages under the 40 hour standard week. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Base pay is calculated as the average hourly earnings of an employee over the prior 26 weeks, excluding weeks with unpaid leave, and including all premium pay. Benefits, such as extended health or pensions, cannot be reduce in actuarial value or employer cost share due to the full time hours standards change. 
    </p>    
    <p>
        For Example:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>40 hours per week x $20.00 per hour = $800.00 per week.</li>
            <li>30 hours per week x 26.67 per hour = $800.10 per week.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Employers cannot discriminate or reduce coverage or delivery of benefit packages or compensation based on amount of hours worked. All employees are entitled to the full benefits offered by employers regardless of full or part time status.
    </p>
    <p>
        Employers may not reduce scheduled hours below the pre-Act average for 18 months without Fair Work Authority approval citing a bona fide downturn.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal is not to force automation. It's to encourage the hiring of more staff and ensuring that we end the unemployment crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
        To clarify and repeat, the transition will be done over four years, smoothly going down from the 40 hour week to the 30 hour week. For example, it would be close to this:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Year 1: 38 hour week</li>
            <li>Year 2: 35 hour week</li>
            <li>Year 3: 32 hour week</li>
            <li>Year 4: 30 hour week</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        <u>Alternative Schedules:</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Employers may apply through the Fair Work Authority (FWA) for an Alternative Schedule  Permit. This permit will allow certain sectors, like healthcare, to provide alternative schedules so long as they are averaging at or below 120 hours of work per month. Employers must calculate overtime both ways, daily (hours beyond scheduled shift) and monthly (hours beyond 120), and pay whichever results in higher overtime compensation. Each hour is counted once; overtime is not paid twice on the same hours. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Sectors that will automatically be granted Alternative Schedule Permits are:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Healthcare</li>
            <li>Emergency Services</li>
            <li>Transportation</li>
            <li>Agriculture</li>
            <li>Continuous industrial operations</li>
            <li>Other sectors designated by the Fair Work Authority</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        <u>Wages:</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Phased in over a four year term, the minimum wage will be increased to $25.00 per hour and indexed to Saskatchewan's general CPI inflation each year to protect its real value.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Year 1: $18 / hour</li>
            <li>Year 2: $20 / hour</li>
            <li>Year 3: $22 / hour</li>
            <li>Year 4: $25 / hour</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Wage theft will be treated with the utmost seriousness. The liability of wage theft will include both the active manager of the enterprise and the owners of the enterprise. Any complaints of wage theft will be heard and investigated by the Fair Work Authority (FWA). Employers will then have 14 days to correct any substantiated claims. Past the 14 days, proven wage theft will face fines of treble the amount of damages, with interest accruing immediately. Further punishment could include possible disbarment from provincial contracts, provincial grant eligibility, and potential loss of business license.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tips are protected wages that belong strictly to the employees, and must be given to the employees within a reasonable timeframe, and never used for business expenses or operations. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Upon employee request, paper copies of any and all paystubs they should have received during their time of employment must be freely available to them for the following three years past their last date of employment.
    </p>
    <p>
        The costs of the Universal Health Levy is strictly prohibited from being passed on to the employee. 
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See Policy 03 - Universal Health for more.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        All employees doing substantially similar or the same roles must be paid equally,  regardless of their identity or their employment status such as if they are full-time or part-time, temp or contract. Although, standard, lawful differentials based on seniority, merit, quantity/quality of output will be allowed. The Fair Work Authority will investigate all claims of inequality. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Overtime and Scheduling:</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        For all workers, overtime will trigger daily on any hours beyond the agreed upon scheduled shift, or any hours above 120 hours per month, whichever is produces the higher earnings. The rate will be based on how much time over the schedule was worked. 
    </p>
    <p>For daily overtime:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hours 1-2 over schedule: 1.5x pay</li>
            <li>Hours 3-5 over schedule: 2x pay</li>
            <li>Hours 6+ over schedule: 2.5x pay</li>
        </ul>
    <p>For monthly overtime:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hours 1-5 over 120 hours per month = 1.5x pay</li>
            <li>Hours 6-10 over 120 hours per month = 2x pay</li>
            <li>Hours 11+ over 120 hours per month = 2.5x pay</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Employers must provide schedules at least 14 days in advance. Changes with less than 72 hours notice require premium pay of 1.25× for the full affected shift(s).
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Rest and Vacation:</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Without rest a worker cannot work. As such, rest will be reinforced into the economy to ensure both it and the workers and healthy. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Workers must have a mandatory 11 consecutive hours off between shifts. No more Close-open (ClOpen shifts). There will be exceptions for emergency services, and for any worker who requests otherwise in writing. This cannot be requested more than once every 48 hours. Employees who are exempted must be compensated with premium pay of 1.5x for the total scheduled hours of that next shift. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Breaks will be mandatory, unable to be waved or combined, and duty free. Employees are entitled to one 20 minute break every 2.5 hours worked and one 30 minute break if a shift exceeds 5.5 hours.         
    </p>
    <p>
        There must be a minimum of 48 consecutive hours off per 7 day period to ensure everyone gets a proper weekend rest. This will be lowered to 24 hours for Alternative Schedule Permit holders.
    </p>
    <p>
        Saskatchewan will join the rest of the modern world and offer comprehensive vacation time. Vacation pay must be either 8%/10%/12% of the employees gross earnings depending on amount of yearly vacation time earned. It will be based on years of service:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 weeks of vacation after 1 year of service.</li>
            <li>5 weeks of vacation after 3 years of service.</li>
            <li>6 weeks of vacation after 5 years of service.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Employees must have the option to cash out their vacation time if requested. Vacation can be carried over year over year Max 4 weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Sick Days:</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        After a three month probation, all employees are entitled to accrue 1.25 days per month of paid, job protected, sick days. The sick days will be split and paid in partnership with business and the Government of Saskatchewan. Businesses will be reimbursed via a payroll tax credit audited by the Fair Work Authority. 
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first 7.5 days worth of wages is paid by the province. </li>
            <li>The second 7.5 days worth of wages is paid by employer.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        When an employee takes a sick day, the employer pays as normal. Employers then report sick days to the Fair Work Authority and receive a payroll tax credit for the provincial portion (up to 7.5 days per employee per year).
    </p>
    <p>
        Sick notes can only be required after 5 consecutive days missed or 6 days within a 14 day period. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Probations and Terminations</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        The maximum probationary period an employer can have will be limited to three months. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Employees terminated without just cause, who have served for more than a year, are entitled to severance pay. The severance must be 1.5 weeks worth of pay per year of service, up to a maximum of 52 weeks. This cannot be offset with EI or earned wages. Any Health benefits must continue for 8 weeks post termination. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Employees continuing service after the three month probationary period can only be let go for just cause. The burden of proof will be on the employer to prove via progressive discipline measures. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When a significant number of workers are laid off at once, advance notice is required to give workers time to prepare and find new employment. Notice requirements will scale with the size of the layoff:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>20-99 workers: 90 days notice</li>
            <li>100-249 workers: 120 days notice</li>
            <li>250+ employees: 180 days notice</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Notice in writing must be provided to each affected employee individually, the Fair Work Authority, and any union representing affected workers. These notices must include:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expected date of termination</li>
            <li>Reason for the layoff</li>
            <li>Whether the layoff is expected to be permanent or temporary</li>
            <li>Contact information for SaskJobs career navigation services</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Exceptions: Notice periods may be shortened if the layoff is caused by unforeseeable business circumstances such as sudden loss of a major contract, natural disaster, or court order. The employer must demonstrate to the Fair Work Authority that the circumstances were not reasonably foreseeable. Even in exceptional circumstances, maximum reasonable notice must still be provided.
    </p>
    <p>
        Non-compliance: Employers who fail to provide required notice must pay each affected employee one day's wages for each day of notice not provided, up to the full notice period.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Gig Protections:</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        All independent contractors are presumed to be employed by the contracting entity, including on the app platforms, unless the hiring entity can prove all three statement are true:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The worker is free from control and direction in performing the work, both under the contract and in fact.</li>
            <li>The worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business.</li>
            <li>The worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed for the hiring entity.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Should a contracting entity be unable to prove all three of the above statements they must provide their employee with: 
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>EI deductions.</li>
            <li>CPP deductions.</li>
            <li>WCB insurance deductions.</li>
            <li>Expense (vehicle, device, data, auto insurance) reimbursement separate from wages</li>
            <li>An earnings floor no less than minimum wage tied to the employee's engaged time.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        <u>Transparency:</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        All job posting must be posted on SaskJobs. Such postings must include the expected range of earnings per hour and per year if full time. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In provincially regulated sectors, any portion of an employment contract that stipulates a non-compete clause is void with narrow exceptions for sale-of-business executive carve-outs to avoid collateral litigation. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In provincially regulated sectors, new employment contracts are strictly prohibited from including any non-compete clauses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any section of a contract forcing arbitration on employees or any class action waiver is void. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In provincially regulated sectors, any portion of new or existing contracts containing a ban on salary-history discussion or wage secrecy clauses are void.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Remote Work and After Hours:</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Remote work is just as productive as in person, and it allows more people to be included in the workforce who otherwise cannot go to an office. As such, any employee may request and receive work from home accommodation for all jobs that can be performed remotely. Such jobs will be identified by sector through regulation. Disputes may be appealed to the Fair Work Authority.
    </p>
    <p>
        Workers must have no less than 50% of their costs of working from home reimbursed by their employer, including:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Internet.</li>
            <li>Electricity.</li>
            <li>One time Equipment Reimbursement (desk, chair, etc).</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        All employees, not just remote workers, have the right to disconnect and not be contacted about work matters after scheduled work hours. 
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contact includes any calls, texts, emails, or app pings.</li>
            <li>Exceptions will be granted for emergency services.</li>
            <li>If contacted about work after work hours, the employee is entitled to on the job pay of a minimum of 2 hours.</li>
            <li>On call workers must receive a stipend and call-in minimum.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Safety:</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Worker safety must be the priority. Things such as extreme weather events must be accommodated for by the employer, ensuring they are provided paid cool-down, warm-up, or clean air breaks. PPE (such as N95 masks), AC and or heaters must be provided by the employer. 
    </p>
    <p>
        All workers have the right to refuse unsafe work and can directly appeal to the Fair Work Authority (FWA) should they feel the work they are being asked to do is unsafe. The FWA will investigate and issue guidance following such an appeal. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Transition Grants:</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        For 48 months after the coming into force of this Act, transition grants will be provided by the Fair Work Authority to Small and Medium sized Enterprises to help them adjust to the new requirements. The exact size and scope of these grants will be determined in consultation and partnership with the business community to address their needs. This will be a process of partnership, not dictation. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>Apprenticeships:</u></strong>
    </p>. 
    <p>
        Apprenticeships in Saskatchewan will be modernized and expanded. The government will work and parter with the Saskatchewan Apprenticeship and Trade Certification Commission (SATCC) to increase traditional apprenticeship spots and infrastructure, as well as create new apprenticeship roles and infrastructure in new sectors. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The The Apprenticeship and Trade Certification Act, 2019 will be amended to create the Century Apprenticeship Program (CAP) by designating the following sectors as able to have apprenticeships and receive Century Certification.
    </p>
    <p>
        Century Certified occupations will bring the proven apprenticeship model—structured on-the-job learning combined with formal instruction—to sectors that have never had it. Initial sectors will include:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Care: Personal Support Workers, Home Care Aides, Mental Health Support Workers, Early Childhood Educators (ECEs)</li>
            <li>Digital/Tech: Software Developers, IT Support Specialists, Data Analysts, Cybersecurity Technicians</li>
            <li>Clean Energy: Heat Pump Technicians, Solar Installation Technicians, Building Energy Auditors</li>
            <li>Logistics: Warehouse Operations Coordinators, Supply Chain Analysts, Cold Chain Technicians</li>
            <li>Agriculture and Food Processing: Precision Agriculture Specialists, Food Processing Technicians</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        The Century Apprenticeship Program (CAP) is distinct from and complementary to the Red Seal trades certification system. Red Seal trades will continue to be governed by existing interprovincial standards. Century Certified occupations are new credential streams for sectors not currently covered by trades certification. Where there is potential overlap, the Province will work with SATCC, trade unions, and industry to ensure clear boundaries and mutual recognition of related competencies.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>The Century Apprenticeship Model:</u>  
    </p>
    <p>
        Century Apprentices split their time between paid on-the-job learning and classroom instruction. Employers will pay apprentice wages during work; the Province funds the instruction. Progress is tracked through digital logbooks managed by SATCC.
    </p>
    <p>
        After completing required hours and assessments, apprentices earn their Century Certified Occupation credential. Experienced professionals can earn Century Mentor designation, qualifying them to supervise and assess apprentices.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Curriculum:</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        The curriculum for each Century Certified occupation will be developed in partnership with:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>SATCC</li>
            <li>Relevant unions and professional associations</li>
            <li>Saskatchewan Polytechnic and the universities</li>
            <li>Industry employers</li>
            <li>Workers with lived experience in the occupation</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Standards will be reviewed every three years to ensure currency, with more frequent updates for rapidly changing fields like technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Procurement Requirements:</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Government contracts and grants above $500,000 must include apprenticeship participation plans, with a target of 15% of total labor hours performed by registered apprentices (Red Seal or Century Certified).
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Employer Incentives:</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Employers will be eligible for tax credits if theyncreate new apprenticeship positions. Those training the new apprentices will be eligible for a Mentor Tax Credit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Employers will receive priority consideration in government procurement if they have strong apprenticeship programs.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>The Fair Work Authority (FWA):</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        A new agency of the Government of Saskatchewan, to be known as the Fair Work Authority (FWA), working under the Ministry of Labour Relations and Workplace Safety, will be created to inspect and enforce the new fair labour rules of the province. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The Fair Work Authority (FWA) will have the power to:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enter workplaces, announced or unannounced.</li>
            <li>Compel any and all relevant records.</li>
            <li>Issue compliance orders.</li>
            <li>Issue grants.</li>
            <li>Issue Administrative Monetary Penalties.</li>
            <li>Administer monthly payroll credits.</li>
            <li>Administer tax credits for employers who open up new apprenticeship placements and spots.</li>
            <li>Take complaints, anonymous or public, from individuals or organizations.</li>
            <li>Fine and garnish entities for non compliance.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Failure to comply with the Fair Work Authority will result in escalating files based on percentage of annual revenues, not static fines, and also ineligibility for grants and other incentives.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>SaskJobs:</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        SaskJobs will be transformed from a passive job board into an active labor market maker that places people into quality jobs or paid training pathways.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Universal Job Posting:</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        All jobs in Saskatchewan must be posted on SaskJobs for a minimum of 14 days before being filled. Postings must include expected pay range and schedule. Exemptions for internal promotions and emergency hires may be granted by the Fair Work Authority.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Career Navigation:</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Career Navigators will be hired throughout the province with caseloads capped at 75 active job seekers per navigator. Navigators will:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Meet personally with job seekers to understand their skills, interests, and constraints</li>
            <li>Match job seekers to opportunities based on fit, not just availability</li>
            <li>Make warm introductions to employers, not just referrals</li>
            <li>Connect job seekers to pathways including SCC, Century Apprenticeships, and education</li>
            <li>Follow up at 30, 90, and 180 days to ensure placements are working</li>
