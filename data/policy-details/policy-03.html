<h3>The Problem</h3>

    <p>
        Public Health Care is slowly being privatized and dismantled, even with most extended healthcare services already being private. At the same time, it is becoming harder and harder to keep a regular family doctor, or any medical professional at all.
    </p>

<h3>The Promise</h3>

    <p>
        The same promise Saskatchewan made over half a century ago: a single payer plan that is $0 at point of service.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just bring your Health Card. That's it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The NCP also commits to the largest recruitment drive this province has ever seen, to ensure we have the people to provide the care we need. 
    </p>

<h3>The Plan</h3>

    <p>
        The NCP will introduce The Saskatchewan Universal Health Act.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Act will expand Saskatchewan's Medicare to create a new Single Payer plan that insures all medically necessary services  in the following areas:
    </p>

            <li>Hospitals and Facility Care</li>

    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is considered medically necessary within each area will be determined by the treating clinician, within peer norms, and guided by independent Benefit Councils made up of clinicians and patient representatives. Government will not have a say in what is medically necessary.</li>
        </ul>

    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Insurance Act will be amended to ensure that no extra billing is allowed for insured medical services, and private insurance companies will be prohibited from offering duplicate coverage. Private insurance will only be allowed for cosmetic or non-medically necessary extras. No two tiered systems.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        <u>Patient Safety:</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Doctors, nurses, and other care staff will be guaranteed safe patient ratios, determined by the Benefit Councils, that if breached will automatically close beds that cannot be safely staffed to ensure patient and practitioner health and safety. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Recruitment:</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        To recruit and retain the healthcare professionals we need, the NCP will:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Offer to raise the wages for all public medical professions by 25% minimum.</li>
            
            <li>Provide a $15,000 bonus to current, new, and returning staff.</li>
            
            <li>Provide free, weekly, Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR) evaluations by the Saskatchewan Health Authority for any out of province or international medical staff, with the evaluations happening as quickly as safely allowable.</li>
            
            <li>Mandate expanded seats for all medical professions in every post-secondary institution in Saskatchewan.</li>
            
            <li>Pay any medical students' tuition and living expenses, in Saskatchewan, in Canada, or in the Commonwealth, provided they agree to stay or move in province, wherever they are placed, for 5 years, with additional bonuses for those who stay 10 years or more.</li>
        </ul>

<h3>The Funding</h3>

    <p>
        The Canada Health Act health transfers will continue, and the NCP is committed to working with the federal government to expand service coverage and funding to meet or exceed Saskatchewan standards. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A new payroll tax shall be implemented, to be known as the Universal Health Levy (UHL).
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The UHL will replace existing private insurance plan payments for most workers and employers.</li>
            <li>Contribution rates will be set within actuarial corridors by an independent, arm's length board (including actuaries, health experts, labour and employer reps), with the goal that the average worker and employer do not pay more overall than they do today for health coverage.</li>
            <li>By law, employers will be prohibited from clawing back the levy through wage cuts or benefit reductions.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Revenues from UHL will go into the General Revenue fund, but by law may only be used for health spending. Each year, the government must report publicly how much of health care is funded by the UHL, federal transfers, and other provincial revenues. Further details can be found in Policy 21 - Funding.
    </p>
<h3>What It Means For You</h3>

    <p>
        It means your health isn't tied to your wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
        It means that your dignity is met where you need it most.
    </p>
    <p>
        It means that in Saskatchewan, we look out for each other.
