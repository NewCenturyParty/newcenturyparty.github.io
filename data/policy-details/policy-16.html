<h3>The Problem</h3>

    <p>
        America owns the entirety of your personal government data. 
    </p>

<h3>The Promise</h3>

    <p>
        The NCP will use the tools we already have available and build out a world class flag in the digital ground for Saskatchewan and Indigenous Communities.
    </p>

<h3>The Plan</h3>

    <p>
       The NCP will introduce:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Saskatchewan Digital Services Act.</li>
            <li>The Saskatchewan Data Sovereignty Act.</li>
            <li>Amendments to The Saskatchewan Telecommunications Act.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        This will allow Saskatchewan to enter the digital age and have a sovereign place within it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>The Saskatchewan Digital Services Act:</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Saskatchewan Digital Services (SDS) will be established as a Crown corporation reporting to the Minister responsible for SaskBuilds and Procurement. Their mandate will be to build out the sovereign digital state of Saskatchewan.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SDS will recruit technical talent through competitive compensation, remote work flexibility, and partnership with Saskatchewan Polytechnic and the University of Saskatchewan's computer science programs. The Saskatchewan Century Corps will include a Digital/Tech stream to develop local talent for government IT roles.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Saskatchewan Tech Stack (SaskStack) that allows the SDS to quickly and easily build custom web-apps for every ministry, agency, and crown of the government. Once finished, the SDS will hand off the daily operations of the apps to SaskBuilds and Procurement, avoiding vendor lock-in completely. This means a single login system, a unified data architecture, single UX/UI, single encryption module, and more, all running locally, on secure SaskTel Cloud Servers. Some of the web apps will be:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The SaskBonds purchasing portal.</li>
            <li>The Saskatchewan Library Authority online portal for borrowing and browsing.</li>
            <li>The Saskatchewan Transport Company's app and website for ticketing and notifications.</li>
            <li>The CodeShare Civics online repository.</li>
            <li>Specific apps for specific departments, designed to fit specific needs.</li>
            <li>And more.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        The SaskStack will include modernizing all Government of Saskatchewan Services so as to be easily doable online, with a single account. New modernized websites will be designed to be intuitive and built with accessibility in mind from day one. 
    </p>
    <p>
        All SaskStack applications must meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards at minimum, with AAA compliance where feasible. Accessibility audits will be conducted before any application launch.
    </p>
    <p>
        The unified login system (SaskAccount) will allow residents to verify their identity once and access all provincial services. Identity verification will build on existing credentials (health card, driver's license) with additional security layers. SaskAccount will NOT be mandatory for services that don't require identity verification. 
    </p>
    <p>
        SaskStack and SaskTel's SaskCloud services will be offered to municipalities and other public bodies at cost. Adoption will be voluntary but encouraged through shared infrastructure savings and integrated service delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
        Existing vendor contracts will be honoured through their terms. Contract renewals will be evaluated against SaskStack alternatives, with migration to provincial systems where functionality and cost are comparable. No new long-term contracts for services that SaskStack can provide will be signed after this Act comes into force.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data security, privacy, and sovereignty will be of utmost priority. Data must be stored and secured using Zero-Trust, ultra secure, privacy principles, in local SaskTel owned servers as soon as possible. All employees must use new password and multi-factor authentication protocols with physical pass-key support available. White Hat Hackers will be contracted to help secure everything.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SDS will build SaskOS, a configured, secure fork of a reliable linux distribution Operating System (OS). To be clear, this will be a long term project, but the goal will be to get off American operating systems which are subject to things like the Patriot Act or the Cloud Act. 
    </p>
    <p>
        SaskOS will be based on an enterprise-grade Linux distribution selected for stability, security, and long-term support. The specific base distribution will be determined by SDS in consultation with cybersecurity experts, with preference for distributions with strong security track records and active maintenance communities.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a phased transition, but within 15 years, all Government of Saskatchewan computers must be running SaskOS exclusively. SaskOS will be made to look familiar to a traditional OS and be as intuitive and accessible as possible. Someone who knows Windows will know how to use SaskOS. Even still, all employees will be given training to ensure they know how to safely, privately, and properly operate the new technology or applications. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Where specialized software requires Windows or macOS, secure virtualization or isolated systems may be used. The goal is to minimize, not eliminate, reliance on proprietary operating systems. SDS will maintain a registry of approved exceptions and work with vendors to develop Linux-compatible alternatives where feasible. 
    </p>
    <p>
        SDS will maintain a 24/7 Security Operations Centre with incident response capabilities. All significant security incidents will be publicly disclosed within 72 hours, with affected residents notified directly. Annual security audits will be conducted by independent third parties and results published.
    </p>
    <p>
        All software developed by or for SDS will be released under open source licenses, allowing other jurisdictions to adopt and adapt Saskatchewan's digital infrastructure. This creates opportunities for collaboration and ensures the province is never locked into proprietary solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        All code will be hosted on the CodeShare Civics Repository, a public platform where residents can view, audit, and propose improvements to government software and policy. 
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See Policy 18 - Democratic Renewal for more.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        In-person and telephone service options will be maintained for all government services. Digital services supplement but do not replace traditional access channels. SaskTel's mandate to provide fibre to every household will reduce but not eliminate the digital divide.
    </p>

        </ul>
    <p>
        <strong><u>The Saskatchewan Data Sovereignty Act:</u></strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Within 10 years: all Government of Saskatchewan data, including its personal information on residents, must be stored and located within local Saskatchewan data servers. This includes all needed cloud infrastructure for Government of Saskatchewan operations. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Data localization will be prioritized, with all government data hosted on Saskatchewan servers within 10 years. The operating system transition will follow, completing within 15 years, allowing SaskStack web applications to function on any platform during the transition period.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ownership, Control, Access, and Possession (OCAP) principles apply to all data of First Nation residents of Saskatchewan.  Their data must belong to them alone, with the Government of Saskatchewan only being a Sovereign Host to the data. The First Nations will always own the lock, keys, and read/write privileges. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The primary goal will be to close out all possible back doors or unauthorized access to resident data. The Province will negotiate data-sharing agreements with federal agencies that specify exactly what data is shared, for what purposes, with what retention limits, and with what security requirements. No bulk data transfers will be permitted. All federal access will be logged and auditable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Residents have the right to request a complete copy of all personal data held by the Government of Saskatchewan in a machine-readable format. Requests will be fulfilled within 30 days at no cost.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>SaskTel:</u></strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        SaskTel will be given a new mandate to ensure Saskatchewan Digital Sovereignty. They will procure and operate local sovereign data server centres in the province. 
    </p>
    <p>
        These sovereign data servers are dedicated to secure data storage and government operations, not commercial AI training. Government use of AI tools will be governed by a separate AI policy ensuring transparency, human oversight, and prohibition on using resident data to train external AI models.
    </p>
    <p>
        For safety and security reasons the centres will be operated in a geographically redundant way. This includes dedicated infrastructure for:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Primary and backup server centres exclusively to be used for Indigenous Data, with total access and control handed off to Indigenous governing bodies. </li>
            <li>Primary and backup server centres for all Government of Saskatchewan personal and private data.</li>
            <li>Primary and backup server centres for its encrypted, enterprise grade, email services.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        These data servers will be ultra secure, encrypted, and private. No one but SaskTel and the relevant Indigenous governing body will have access to the Saskatchewan peoples' data or the Indigenous Peoples of Saskatchewan data respectively. Neither government nor Indigenous data will be shared with external parties except pursuant to a valid court order issued by a Canadian court.
    </p>
    <p>
        SaskTel will then use these servers to run and operate SaskCloud. SaskCloud is a cloud service that will securely and privately host Government Data. It will be the back end supporting all the new SaskStack applications. Regular citizens may sign up to use SaskCloud to privately store their own personal data in the cloud. 
    </p>
    <p>
        SaskCloud personal accounts will be priced to cover costs, not generate profit. Initial pricing will offer 250GB free storage for Saskatchewan residents, with additional storage at rates competitive with commercial providers.
    </p>
    <p>
        SaskTel will also be given the mandate to remake its email service to be a modern, above enterprise grade, email provider for the Government of Saskatchewan. This will allow the Government of Saskatchewan to securely and privately, via end to end encryption, send emails internally, as well externally by single point encryption. No one but the Government of Saskatchewan will ever be able to read or access them. 
    </p>
    <p>
        SaskTel email will initially serve government users, with public availability phased in over five years as capacity expands. Priority will be given to residents who request accounts for privacy or security reasons. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The reimagined SaskTel email service will also include standard modern email services such as todo lists, calendars, and invites, and more. It will also be open to the public so that Saskatchewan residents may also enjoy the ultra secure and private email service, away from prying American eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
        SaskTel will also be mandated to remain net-neutral. They are to treat the internet as utility, no different than electricity. 
    </p>

<h3>The Funding</h3>

    <p>
        The upfront funding for capital intensive projects like SaskTel's Sovereign Data Servers will be funded by SaskBonds, with operating costs coming from the General Revenue Fund.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cost savings will come via lack of numerous and exorbitant vendor fees and fees charged for services.
    </p>

<h3>What It Means For You</h3>

    <p>
        It means a modern, digital friendly, government that meets you where you are. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It means your data isn't used to train an AI model making the internet worse.
    </p>
    <p>
        It means the dignity in your data being your own, private and protected.
    </p>
