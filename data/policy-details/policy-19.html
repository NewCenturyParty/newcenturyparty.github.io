<h3>The Problem</h3>

    <p>
        Saskatchewan doesn't have the tools or means to build its own future.
    </p>

<h3>The Promise</h3>

    <p>
        The NCP will bring back manufacturing in a way that serves the people and the goals of Saskatchewan.
    </p>

<h3>The Plan</h3>

    <p>
        The NCP will introduce The Saskatchewan Manufacturing Corporation Act, which will allow Saskatchewan to start building our own future. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>The Saskatchewan Manufacturing Corporation:</u></strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        A new Crown corporation known as the Saskatchewan Manufacturing Corporation (SMC) will be established. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The SMC will be mandated to build and operate new modern factories in Saskatchewan, producing what we need, ourselves, using the greenest available technologies and Canadian made supplies where possible. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The costs will be competitive for each industry, with the goal of bring in profitable returns and solid growth. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The SMC Board will include representatives from customer Crowns (SHC, SaskEnergy, SaskPower, SaskGrocery) representatives from worker unions, Indigenous governing body representation, independent directors with manufacturing expertise, and community representatives from facility locations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SMC will prioritize "human-in-the-loop" automation that enhances worker productivity rather than replacing workers entirely. Any automation will focus on dangerous, repetitive, or precision tasks. Job creation targets will be set for each facility and reported annually. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If automation reduces labor needs below targets, workers will be redeployed to new SMC facilities or offered transition support.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SMC will partner with the Saskatchewan Century Corps to train factory workers through the Infrastructure & Housing stream and Operations & Logistics stream.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See Policy 11 - The Saskatchewan Century Corps for more.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        All SMC construction projects will utilize Standing Master Agreements with the Saskatchewan Century Corps, providing training opportunities in the Infrastructure & Housing stream. Once operational, SMC facilities will offer permanent employment pathways for SCC graduates.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SMC will license out the factory designs from factories where similar work is already being done around the world. That way we can focus on building right away. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Apprenticeship programs will be established for skilled trades positions (millwrights, electricians, welders, machinists).
    </p>
    <p>
        All SMC facilities will be unionized workplaces with wages and benefits meeting or exceeding new fair labour standard.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See Policy 09 - Fair Labour for more.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        SMC will prioritize hiring from Energy Veterans transitioning from oil and gas who are interested in any of the factories. 
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See Policy 10 - Energy Veterans for more.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Each factory will be mandated to achieve Net-Zero Operations using 100% renewable power within ten years of operations. They will be required to generate its own renewable power and operate grid scale batteries to offset the higher grid load the factories require. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Each product produced by the SMC must come with a digital material passport that lists exactly what materials are in it, ensuring it can be recycled safely in the future. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To meet these clean energy requirements, all SMC facilities will be built to passive house or equivalent energy standards. Rooftop and on-site solar will provide at least 50% of regular facility power. There will be Grid-scale battery storage that will provide 8 hours of backup power and grid stabilization services. The process heat will be electrified where possible; remaining heat needs will use SaskEnergy thermal loops or geothermal.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SMC factories will follow a “zero-waste” manufacturing policy. All material waste will be recycled, composted, or converted to energy.
    </p>
    <p>
        All SMC factories will use a mix of cutting edge automation and human skilled trades, ensuring high paid jobs as well as high speed production.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SMC will not seek to displace existing Saskatchewan-owned processors that meet provincial standards and labor requirements. All SMC facilities will be sized and located to fill gaps in existing processing capacity, not duplicate it. Existing processors may be offered supply agreements or partnership opportunities with SAB and SaskGrocery.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where existing facilities are foreign-owned or fail to meet standards, the SMC may offer to acquire them at fair market value.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SMC will operate as a holding company with distinct subsidiaries:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>SMC Housing Inc.</li>
            <li>SMC Energy Inc.</li>
            <li>SMC Agriculture Inc.</li>
            <li>SMC Nuclear Inc.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Each subsidiary will have its own management team, budget, and performance targets, while sharing corporate services and governance.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>SMC Housing Inc</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The first priority of the SMC is to build a pre-fab, modular, housing factory to be known as SMC-H1. It will be located in or near Saskatoon or Regina to access labor markets and transportation. 
    </p>
    <p>
        SMC-H1 will focus on building modular, easily connected, volumetric modules, such as bathrooms, kitchens, and panelized walls, ensuring they meet the new housing code standards. The housing designs will follow SaskHomes universal designs so they will be uniquely Saskatchewan, ready for the 21st Century, and easily built in a factory and or on site. 
    </p>
    <p>
        New supply agreements and partnerships will be made with the Saskatchewan Forestry sector to ensure that local resources are used where possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        SMC-H factories will operate 24/7 with four rotating shifts of workers, each working 30-hour weeks per new Fair Labour Standards, ensuring continuous production capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Saskatchewan Housing Corporation (SHC) will sign multi-year contracts and demand agreements, ensuring that the demand is there for 24/7 production of SaskHomes.
    </p>
    <p>
        All SMC-H products will meet or exceed National Building Code and Saskatchewan's newly enhanced 21st Century building standards. SMC-H factories will pursue third-party certification for modular construction quality.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See Policy 05 - Housing Crisis for more.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        While the primary output will be for Saskatchewan, units will be available for sale to other provinces or territories facing similar housing crises. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal is for SMC-H1 to have the capacity to produce 5,000-10,000 housing units annually, ramping to full production within 3 years of groundbreaking.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>SMC Energy Inc</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        SMC will build an assembly factory, to be known as SMC-E1, and it will be tasked to assemble and produce the heat pumps needed for homes to connect with SaskEnergy's new Thermal Utility, and the hardware for SaskPower's Virtual Power Plant. SMC-E1 will also assemble residential-scale, commercial-scale and grid-scale batteries, purchasing the cells off the global market. 
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See Policy 06 - 21st Century Connected Communities for more.</li>
            <li>See Policy 15 - Resource and Energy Sovereignty for more.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        SMC-E1 will be co-located with SMC-H1 for supply chain efficiency. Each item produced by the SMC-E factories must be designed to be fully and easily repairable and replaceable as the technology matures. 
    </p>
    <p>
        SMC-E1 will sell Thermal Utility Conversation Kits that will have all the parts and appliances needed to convert a home to using SaskEnergy's thermal loops. These kits can be purchased by private individuals, but will mainly be sold to SaskEnergy for implementation. 
    </p>
    <p>
        SMC-E products will meet CSA standards for electrical equipment and carry full warranties.
    </p>
    <p>
        Excess SMC-E heat pumps and other products designed for Saskatchewan's climate will be marketed and sold across the Canadian prairies and northern US.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal for SMC-E1 is to produce around 50,000 heat pump units annually, sufficient for SaskEnergy's 10-year conversion program.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>SMC Agriculture Inc</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The SMC will build out Saskatchewan's local agricultural processing capacity in three main ways: regional abattoirs, regional oil crushing and bottling facilities, and regional flour mills.
    </p>
    <p>
        SMC-Ag Abattoirs will be build around the province, distributed across agricultural regions,  co-located with nearby livestock farms, so that local farmers don't have to ship to Alberta unless they so choose. The goal is up to six regional abattoirs constructed over 5 years, each with capacity for at least 200 head per day.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SMC will build an oil crushing and bottling factory so that Saskatchewan Canola Oil is made in Saskatchewan. The goal is one canola crushing and bottling facility with capacity of 1 million tonnes annually.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SMC-Ag Flour mills will use local wheat to ensure local wheat makes local flour to make local breads. The goal is two regional flour mills with a combined capacity of 500,000 tonnes annually. The flour mills will be located on major rail lines for easy grain access.
    </p>
    <p>
        All SMC-Ag facilities will be partnered with the Saskatchewan Agricultural Board (SAB) as to ensure local farmers in local pools provide the materials for local production. Saskatchewan will learn to feed itself. 
    </p>
    <p>
        All SMC-Ag facilities will meet CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency) standards for interprovincial and international sales.
    </p>
    <p>
        SaskGrocery will sign long-term purchase agreements for SMC-Ag products, guaranteeing minimum volumes of Saskatchewan flour, canola oil, and processed meat for its retail and wholesale operations.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See Policy 14 - Food Sovereignty for more.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        <strong><u>SMC Nuclear Inc</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The SMC will build and operate a uranium conversion facility, SMC-N1, and fuel fabrication plant, SMC-N2, in partnership with the Saskatchewan Natural Resources Corporation (SNRC).
    </p>
    <p>
        SMC-N facilities will be developed in partnership with SNRC as described in Policy 15 - Resource and Energy Sovereignty, with SMC handling manufacturing operations and SNRC handling resource extraction and strategic oversight, and together insuring smooth supply chain logistics from one to the other. 
    </p>
    <p>
        SMC-N1 will be converting the yellowcake uranium oxide we area already produce into uranium dioxide powder. Then SMC-N2 will fabricate that powder into CANDU fuel bundles.
    </p>
    <p>
        These facilities will supply SaskPower's new CANDU reactor fleet, with excess capacity available for export to other Canadian utilities so that SMC-N fuel fabrication will serve the Canadian nuclear industry nationally.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a byproduct of CANDU operations, medical isotope production, particularly Molybdenum-99, will be captured and processed for the global medical imaging market.
    </p>
    <p>
        All nuclear facilities will meet Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission requirements and operate under federal nuclear licensing with provincial ownership.
    </p>
    <p>
        SMC-N facilities will be located near existing uranium mining infrastructure in northern Saskatchewan, creating high-wage jobs in the north. Northern facilities will have Indigenous hiring targets of at least 30%, developed in partnership with local First Nations.
    </p>

<h3>The Funding</h3>

    <p>
        The ongoing operating funds will be paid for through the General Revenue Fund.
    </p>
    <p>
        Costs will be offset by the sales and processing fees generated by the factories. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Export revenues will offset operating costs and provide returns to the province.
    </p>
    <p>
        SaskBonds Manufacturing Series will be issued in tranches tied to construction milestones.
    </p>
