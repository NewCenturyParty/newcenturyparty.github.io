<h3>The Problem</h3>

    <p>
        Our home is actively being destroyed by the fossil fuel industry, who knows, and has always known, exactly what they are doing.
    </p>

<h3>The Promise</h3>

    <p>
        The NCP will immediately do everything in its power, be it regulatory, fiscal, or legal, to tackle the climate crisis and hold to account the people in power responsible.
    </p>

<h3>The Plan</h3>

    <p>
       <strong><u>Short Term: The Redwater Strategy</u></strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Immediately upon forming government, the NCP will submit an Order-in-Council ending all fossil fuel, and other resource subsidies, be it tax credit, grant, royalty adjustment, Crown loan, or infrastructure subsidy. The Government of Saskatchewan will also immediately drop any and all Carbon Tax lawsuits.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Minister of Environment will announce that it is conducting comprehensive integrity assessments of all pipeline infrastructure in Saskatchewan, including seismic vulnerability analysis, corrosion surveys, flood exposure mapping, tailings ponds, and aging infrastructure review.
    </p>
    <p>
        While interprovincial pipelines fall under federal jurisdiction, provincial environmental assessments of pipeline corridors, land access permits, and extraction operations remain within provincial authority. The Government of Saskatchewan will coordinate with federal regulators where required and pursue parallel federal accountability through the Climate Crisis Lawsuit.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Minister of Environment will update the Liability Management Ratio for all oil and gas companies (LMR) to 2.0. The Minister will order any company below 2.0 to post a cash bond for the difference. Current LMR requirements have proven inadequate, with many operators maintaining ratios below 1.0. The new 2.0 standard ensures assets are worth at least twice estimated cleanup costs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Companies may post 25% within 90 days and the remainder over 12 months, with the province holding a security interest in the assets during the payment period. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If any company cannot or refuses to post the required 25% of the bond within 90 days, and the full cash bond in 12 months, the regulator will deem the company unable to meet its statutory environmental obligations. Licenses for non-compliant assets will be suspended and placed under provincial receivership via the SNRC as operator of last resort.
    </p>
    <p>
        Should the oil majors agree and pay the bonds, that bond money will be held in the Saskatchewan Financial Group exclusively for future remediation costs. However, any interest or investment income generated by these holdings will be entirely remitted to the Saskatchewan Sovereignty Fund. 
    </p>
    <p>
        While the oil majors may scream expropriation, they will be able to get their assets back if they post the full cash bond within 12 months. Saskatchewan is simply regulating a harmful substance and protecting our environment. This is something directly within Provincial rights, and because the companies are saying they are unable to pay for the clean up costs, they are thus insolvent in the eyes of the Government and the Government must take on the liability to ensure environmental obligations are met. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The Government, now in ownership of the assets through the SNRC, will offer to give new licenses to the oil majors to operate their assets again, but with restrictions. They must clean up orphaned wells starting immediately. They must pay the Energy Veterans Surcharge. And finally they must agree to a 15 year sunset on all Oil and Gas operations in the province.
    </p>
    <p>
        The 15-year sunset will include a structured phase-down: extraction permits will decline by 10% annually for the first 10 years, then 20% annually for years 11-15, with priority given to completing cleanup of legacy sites. New exploration permits will not be issued. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Workers employed at assets transferred to provincial operation will be offered immediate employment with the SNRC at equivalent wages, with full eligibility for Energy Veterans benefits through and after the sunset period.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SNRC will maintain contingency agreements with experienced operators and will prioritize retention of existing workforce under provincial employment to ensure Deemed Continuity. Energy Veterans who remain to operate transitioning assets will receive full program benefits while ensuring continuity of operations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Should they not agree, they will be responsible for a "Monday Morning Problem" where the SNRC is not yet ready to take over operations. They will then have to explain to the White House and the American Mid-West why gas is about to triple and why their homes will go cold. The NCP is confident the oil majors will agree to this new operating license agreement. However, if they truly will not work in the best interests of their customers, the Government of Saskatchewan will not permit any gap in energy supply to Saskatchewan residents, Ottawa, or our American trading partners. Contingency operations plans will be activated within 24 hours of any operator abandonment, with full continuity guaranteed. 
    </p>
    <p>
        They may ask for a stay / injunction (a pause) so they can hold the Government up in court. We will argue that doing so allows them to only further loot the province and then declare bankruptcy at the end of the lawsuit anyways. This is the only way we ensure they pay for their mess, which they have freely admitted they are not able to do. 
    </p>
    <p>
        They will try to use shell companies. We will institute a 5 year look back period. If a company transferred assets or paid dividends while their true LMR was below compliance the parent companies and individual directors will be personally and jointly liable for the cleanup bond. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The Government anticipates legal challenges under investment treaties and will vigorously defend Saskatchewan's sovereign right to regulate environmental liabilities within its borders. Someone has to. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>Long Term: The Act and The Lawsuit</u></strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        The NCP will introduce the Saskatchewan Climate Crisis Act.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Act will grant every Saskatchewan Resident  the right to a healthy environment, as determined by independent scientific consensus. Any breach of that is a violation of their rights, dignity, and Saskatchewan law.
    </p>
    <p>
        If any provision of this Act is found to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, that provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Act shall continue in full force and effect.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regardless of litigation outcomes, the regulatory measures in this Act—including the right to a healthy environment, SEEA's ongoing monitoring, and the phase-down of fossil fuel operations—remain in force.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similar to the fight against Big Tobacco, the Rules of Civil Procedure will be updated so they can no longer be used against the Government when trying to seek climate justice. The following changes will be made:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Burden of Proof:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the province can demonstrate that a defendant (a) produced or promoted fossil fuels and (b) knew or ought to have known about the climate risks, it is presumed that their actions contributed to climate damages in Saskatchewan.</li>
                    <li>The burden then shifts entirely to the defendant to prove that their specific emissions did not contribute to the damage. </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Statistical and Aggregate Evidence Admissibility:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The use of epidemiological, sociological, and climate-attribution data to prove damages is explicitly permitted. </li>
                    <li>Individual and specific litres of gas or other fossil product need not be proven to cause specific damages, rather such fossil product can be proven to increase the statistical probability and or severity of climate damages such as wildfires, droughts, and climate related health issues in the province. </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Liability by Market Share:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Because we share one planet, and pollution in one place may damage the environment of another place in the world, liability will be established based on the defendant's share of the global market for fossil fuels during the period of deception. </li>
                    <li>If a company is responsible for 2% of historic global emissions, they are thus liable for 2% of Saskatchewan's total climate damages. </li>
                    <li>This liability is joint and several among all named defendants in the lawsuit, meaning if one defendant cannot satisfy its portion of the judgment, the remaining defendants are jointly responsible for the full amount.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Retroactive Application:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>These procedural rules apply to all climate-related litigation filed after this Act comes into force. The underlying causes of action—fraud, negligence, nuisance, unjust enrichment—apply to conduct whenever it occurred, consistent with existing common law principles and limitation periods.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Asset Forfeiture for Non-Payment:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Act will mandate that failure to satisfy a court judgment results in the immediate seizure of any and all assets located within the province to satisfy the debt. </li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    <p>
        The Saskatchewan Environmental Economics Agency (SEEA) will be established with a mandate to provide an accurate and full economic breakdowns of all the externalities related to fossil fuels. The damages done to the Saskatchewan environment, Saskatchewan resident's health, crop yield changes, as well as the expected costs of remediation now and into the future as climate change worsens. 
    </p>
    <p>
        SEEA will have the power to compel any and all records, testimony, and proprietary data from any company operating in Saskatchewan's fossil fuel sector, with penalties for non-compliance equivalent to contempt of court.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the moment SEEA confirms their work is done and ready, the Government of Saskatchewan, using the SEEA's data, will bring forth the most comprehensive lawsuit in the history of this province, suing the fossil fuel industry and Ottawa for willful and extraordinary, damages, deception, neglect, and in the case of Ottawa, gross regulatory negligence.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Government of Saskatchewan will be seeking full compensation for past, present, and projected future climate damages, which preliminary estimates suggest could reach into the trillions of dollars over the coming decades. That money will by law go to the Saskatchewan Sovereignty Fund. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Financial institutions that provided material financing to fossil fuel extraction while in possession of knowledge about climate risks, and failed to disclose those risks to shareholders and the public, may be named as defendants under theories of aiding and abetting, civil conspiracy, or securities fraud.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Government of Saskatchewan will offer the federal government a clear arrangement: in exchange for federal non-interference with the rest of the Saskatchewan 21 Policies,  Saskatchewan will exclude the federal government from the Climate Crisis Lawsuit's regulatory negligence claims.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Government will pursue enforcement through all available domestic and international mechanisms, including asset seizure within Canadian jurisdiction, reciprocal enforcement treaties, and coordination with other jurisdictions pursuing similar claims.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are seeking full compensation, which could amount to trillions over the coming decades. We expect vigorous defence and lengthy litigation. Regardless of final recovery amounts, this lawsuit will establish accountability and force disclosure of industry knowledge that the public deserves to see.
    </p>
    <p>
