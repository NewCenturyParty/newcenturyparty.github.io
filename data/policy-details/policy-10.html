<h3>The Problem</h3>

    <p>
        The workers who build and power the world as we know it are tied up and invested in a dying industry that will soon abandon them. 
    </p>

<h3>The Promise</h3>

    <p>
        The NCP will support oil and gas sector workers ready to join the 21st Century economy.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will treat the Energy Veterans with the respect they deserve. 
    </p>

<h3>The Plan</h3>

    <p>
        The NCP will introduce The Saskatchewan Energy Veterans Act. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We will honour our Energy Veterans. They turned their raw work and determination and used it to power the modern world. Our Hospitals, our schools,  our heated homes in -40°C. They are the best at what they do and they are exactly who we need. They built the old world. It's time to hire them to build the new one. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This Act will be available to all workers in specified Oil and Gas NAICS code industries (extraction, pipelines, support, etc), including related dependent contractors and on-site service workers who physically work over 50% of hours in the specified Oil and Gas industries, to choose three different pathways out of the industry.
    </p>
    <p>
        To be eligible, workers must have been working in the specified Oil and Gas NAICS code industries for 24 of the last 60 months, have the legal right to live or work in Saskatchewan, and commit to residing and working in Saskatchewan for five years or more, unless they are retiring. Workers can only apply once. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The Energy Veterans Agency (EVA) will be established to act as the program manager for the workers joining the new economy.  
    </p>
    <p>
        For the first year of the Act coming into force, the offer will be exclusive to Saskatchewan residents who have lived and worked in province for more than two years. After that first year, the offer will be opened up and available to all Oil and Gas NAICS sector workers across Canada. These pathways will sunset after 15 years. 
    </p>
    <p>
        These pathways are voluntary. Workers who prefer to remain in the oil and gas sector may do so, though they are encouraged to plan for the industry's eventual sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>Retire:</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        For the Energy Veterans who have served their time and are ready to take their well deserved rest, the province of Saskatchewan will honour them with:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A $15,000 Energy Veterans Bonus. </li>
            <li>A new Saskatchewan Prosperity Medal will be bestowed to honour a worker's service and contribution to Saskatchewan Prosperity.</li>
            <li>Four (4) years of Energy Veterans Debt Shield Protections. </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Province will provide a "Debt Shield" which will reimburse 100% of the interest on your primary residential mortgage and one primary vehicle each month during those four years. </li>
                </ul>
            <li>A Pension Bridge that will pay the unreduced expected pension for the individual for up to 6 years until they qualify for their OAS/CPP or their plan's full unreduced pension.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        <strong><u>Retrain:</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        For those who want to go and learn something new, or further their existing knowledge, in priority sectors such as nuclear or geothermal, the province will offer:
    </p>
         <ul>
            <li>A $15,000 Energy Veterans Bonus. </li>
            <li>A new Saskatchewan Prosperity Medal will be bestowed to honour a worker's service and contribution to Saskatchewan Prosperity.</li>
            <li>Four (4) years of Energy Veterans Debt Shield Protections. </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Province will provide a "Debt Shield" which will reimburse 100% of the interest on your primary residential mortgage and one primary vehicle each month during those four years. </li>
                </ul>
            <li>A 1 : 1 Pension / Ticket Parity. We will honour your ticket and earned experience, including time used for education. This means if you have 20 years in the patch, you will have 20 years of pension seniority.</li>
            <li>A full scholarship (tuition, fees, books, tools, bus pass) for any post-secondary or vocational training done in Saskatchewan, provided they meet satisfactory academic progress and performance.</li>
            <li>Wage replacement matching the best T4 from the past five years while in school. However, there will be a limit of $75,000 per year, with satisfactory academic performance stipulations.</li>
            <li>A monthly childcare stipend for workers with children under 13 while in full-time education, covering up to 90% of licensed childcare costs.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        <strong><u>Redeploy:</u></strong>
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A $15,000 Energy Veterans Bonus. </li>
            <li>A new Saskatchewan Prosperity Medal will be bestowed to honour a worker's service and contribution to Saskatchewan Prosperity.</li>
            <li>Four (4) years of Energy Veterans Debt Shield Protections. </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Province will provide a "Debt Shield" which will reimburse 100% of the interest on your primary residential mortgage and one primary vehicle each month during those four years. </li>
                </ul>
            <li>A 1 : 1 Pension / Ticket Parity. We will honour your ticket and earned experience, including time used for education. This means if you have 20 years in the patch, you will have 20 years of pension seniority.</li>
            <li>Job placement priority in partnership with SaskJobs, who will actively place skilled workers into relevant positions ready to start right away, or in a position in the Saskatchewan Century Corps to learn a new role on the job. No one is making a driller learn to code. </li>
            <li>Employers like SaskEnergy will hire drillers for their geothermal and ambient loop projects. SaskPower will hire skilled welders for the high pressure CANDU nuclear reactors piping. We aren't asking roughnecks to learn to code. Companies will need experts on these wells in order to clean and cap them properly. We are asking them to do the same jobs, just with more security, pensions, and the ability to sleep in their own beds at the end of the day. </li>
            <li>Hazardous duty pay added to the base rate to match industry norms.</li>
            <li>While positions utilizing similar skills will offer similar wages as Oil and Gas jobs, the Government of Saskatchewan will offer "Wage Top Ups" for up to four years if the new job pays less than the worker's old Oil and Gas sector job. The Top Ups will cover 100% of the wage difference from month 1, and gradually decline, month by month, to 0%.</li>
            <li>Relocation grants will be offered and vary depending on distance and family size to help pay for the move and the first three months of new housing. </li>

        </ul>
    <p>
        <strong><u>The Energy Veterans Agency</u></strong>
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Energy Veterans Agency (EVA) will handle the applications and payment disbursements for these pathways, and work with other organizations like SaskJobs to  place people into new jobs.</li>
            <li>Case managers will be hired with caseloads capped at 75 workers each to ensure personal and timely service. The EVA will also prevent fraud and misuse by:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conducting random audits.</li>
                    <li>Compelling records.</li>
                    <li>Preventing duplicate applications.</li>
                    <li>Clawing back benefits for those who leave the new jobs within 12 months without just cause. Just cause includes layoff, unsafe working conditions, health circumstances, or family emergency, as determined by the EVA.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Case managers will be hired and capped at 60 applicants to ensure personal and timely service. </li>
        </ul>

<h3>The Funding</h3>

    <p>
        In specified Oil and Gas NAICS codes industries, businesses will pay a 5.5% Energy Veterans Security surcharge on all annual Saskatchewan revenues. This surcharge will be paid into the Saskatchewan Sovereignty Fund.
    </p>
    <p>
        A ring fenced portion of an annual endowment from the Saskatchewan Sovereignty Fund will be paid to the General Revenue Fund, which by law must be used for the above stated Energy Veteran pathways and the Energy Veterans Agency. 
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See Policy 17 - Financial Sovereignty for more.</li>
        </ul>

<h3>What It Means For You</h3>

    <p>
        It means a lifeboat out of a dying industry.
    </p>
    <p>
        It means clean work and a clean conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
        It means the dignity of building a better future.
