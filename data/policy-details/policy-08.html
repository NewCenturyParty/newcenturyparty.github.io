<h3>The Problem</h3>

    <p>
        People don't own their work nor the value they create.
    </p>

<h3>The Promise</h3>

    <p>
        The NCP will make sure it’s easy to own your own work and your own value in Saskatchewan.
    </p>


<h3>The Plan</h3>

    <p>
        The NCP will introduce amendments to existing legislation, as well as two new Acts:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Saskatchewan Co-operative Development Agency Act</li>
            <li>The Saskatchewan Right of Worker First Refusal Act.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        These acts will give people the tools they need to own their work, own their value, and own their dignity. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>The Saskatchewan Co-operative Development Agency Act:</u></strong>
    </p>    
    <p>
        This Act will established the Saskatchewan Co-operative Development Agency (SCDA). The SCDA will be mandated to help anyone form a co-op in Saskatchewan, either by converting an existing business, or starting something new. The SCDA will act as a one stop shop for regular support, financial brokering, and conversion support.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SCDA will have dedicated units for helping to convert existing businesses into co-ops, in particular those exercising their Right of First Refusal, by helping current employees know their rights, and use those rights to collectively purchase their place of employment.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SCDA will act as a brokerage, working with local banks or credit unions to find the best possible rates for co-ops requiring business loans for operations or for conversions. Fees for brokering or other services by the SCDA will be kept low for small or start up co-ops and scale up based on size of co-op and complexity of any buyouts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Should no bank or credit union offer reasonable funding, the Saskatchewan Financial Group will be used as a last resort. They will develop loan guarantee programs specifically for worker buyouts facilitated by the SCDA, ensuring financing is available for viable conversions.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See Policy 17 - Financial Sovereignty for more.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        The SCDA will provide workshops and training for new or potential co-op owners so they can hit the ground running. Templates will be provided for the regular requirements of every co-op or business in a variety of areas, including:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Regulations</li>
            <li>Bylaws</li>
            <li>Membership agreements</li>
            <li>Basic HR</li>
            <li>Payroll</li>
            <li>Board Training</li>
            <li>Board charters</li>
            <li>Voting rules</li>
            <li>Market access</li>
            <li>Marketing</li>
            <li>Annual Meetings</li>
            <li>Conflict of Interest Policies</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        <strong><u>The Right of Worker First Refusal Act:</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        All Business Owners must file a Notice of Intent and submit relevant business information with the Fair Work Authority (FWA) whenever they intend to: 
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sale of assets exceeding 40% of total business value, as determined by the most recent financial statements or independent valuation</li>
            <li>Pause operations for a long-term timeframe</li>
            <li>Permanently close the business</li>
            <li>Move operations to another location outside of Saskatchewan</li>
            <li>File for bankruptcy and receivership</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        If the sale or transfer is to a family member, then the FWA will approve it immediately. However, if no family wishes to be involved, the FWA will pause the sale or closure for 150 days. They will then inform the Saskatchewan Co-operative Development Agency (SCDA) of the Notice of Intent and give them the relevant business and employee contact information. 
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See Policy 09 - Fair Labour for more.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        During this 150 day window, the SCDA will contact any employees who currently work, and have worked for more than one year, at the business and inform them of their Right of First Refusal to collectively, with other employees of the same or higher seniority, purchase the business that employs them. No other bids can be made at this time, and the employee bid must be considered in good faith. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Further, any bona fide third-party offer in the next two years following the 150 day exclusivity window, must be disclosed so that employees may match it. If the offers are substantially the same between any third party and the employees, the Business Owners must choose the employee offer.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Fair Work Authority will determine whether offers are substantially equivalent, considering total value, payment terms, and conditions. Guidance on equivalency standards will be published by regulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any employees who are interested in purchasing the business to transition it into a co-operative will have the full backing of the SCDA to make a serious bid. Should no attempted bid be made by the employees and the exclusivity offer ends, then Business Owners are free to sell to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
        Related-party and below-market deals are considered as full sales subject to the Right of First Refusal and FWA scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Act applies to businesses with five or more employees. Sole proprietors and businesses with fewer than five employees are exempt from the Notice of Intent requirement but may voluntarily engage the SCDA for succession planning.
    </p>
    <p>
        Businesses operating under franchise agreements are subject to the terms of those agreements, which may limit conversion options.
    </p>

<h3>The Funding</h3>

    <p>
        The funding will come out of General Revenues as well as consulting and brokerage fees from the Saskatchewan Co-operative Development Agency's daily operations. 
    </p>

<h3>What It Means For You</h3>

    <p>
        It means you own your work.
    </p>
    <p>
        It means you own your value.
    </p>
    <p>
        It means you own your dignity.
    </p>
