<h3>The Problem</h3>
    
    <p>
        For generations, settlers have determined the lives of the Indigenous Peoples of this land. The Government of Saskatchewan has made little real attempt to change that.
    </p>

<h3>The Promise</h3>

    <p>
        An NCP government will enact of all 94 Calls to Action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission within its capacity to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        An NCP government will recognize and adopt as law the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).
    </p>
    <p>
        The Office of the Reconciliation Commissioner will be established, co-governed and co-developed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Office of Missing Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls 2 Spirit (MMIWG2S) will be established, co-governed and co-developed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Right of First Refusal will be given to Treaty Nations on all provincial Crown Land sales.
    </p>
    <p>
        September 30 will become a statutory holiday in recognition of the National Day of Truth and Reconciliation.
    </p>

<h3>The Plan</h3>

    <p>
        Immediately upon gaining office, the NCP will reach out to all Saskatchewan Treaty Nations and organizations, as well as welcome all Indigenous voices, to begin the formal process of building the Consent Protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Consent Protocol will be a binding requirement of the Government of Saskatchewan, stating that before being able to proceed on any project, policy, or action that might affect Indigenous lands, communities, waters, heritage, culture, language, or livelihoods, the relevant Indigenous governing body or organization must give their free, prior, and informed consent. This must, where relevant, include things such as:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cost-sharing</li>
            <li>Revenue-sharing</li>
            <li>Job opportunities</li>
            <li>Capacity funding for those affected</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        With partnership from all Saskatchewan Treaty Nations and organizations, a complete and total review of all Government of Saskatchewan activities and initiatives towards completing the 94 Calls to Action must be submitted to the Legislature within the first term of an NCP government. As well, every Ministry, Crown, Agency, or government body must submit a detailed plan on how they will achieve each of the 94 Calls To Action that are possible within its scope and ability. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The new Offices for the Reconciliation Commissioner and the MMIWG shall be co-developed with Saskatchewan Indigenous nations and governing bodies who will together bring the offices to light.
    </p>
    <p>
        The new Offices for the Reconciliation Commissioner and for MMIWG2S will be co-developed with Saskatchewan Indigenous nations and governing bodies, who will together bring these offices into being.
    </p>
    <p>
        And the first September 30th after the NCP forms government shall be the first statutory holiday in recognition of the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. 
    </p>
    <p>
        What comes next cannot be dictated. Only walked, hand in hand, together.
    </p>

<h3>The Funding</h3>

    <p>
        Operating funds for the Offices will be received as statutory, multi-year funding from the General Revenue Fund. This must include capacity funding for Consent Protocols to ensure Indigenous nations and organizations can fully participate in consultation and consent processes with their own legal, technical, and Elders' support.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Saskatchewan Sovereignty Fund will have a dedicated ring-fenced Reconciliation Fund which will make annual, controlled, transfers to the General Revenue Fund, which by law may only be used for reconciliation initiatives, such as Treaty Land Entitlement, Indigenous-led infrastructure, language and cultural revitalization, and other priorities co-designated with Indigenous nations and organizations.

<h3>What It Means For You</h3>

    <p>
        It means listening.
    </p>
    <p>
        It means working together.
    </p>
    <p>
        It means the dignity of trying to heal.
