The Saskatchewan Century Corps (SCC)

The Why 

Unemployment is Rising
The Cost of Living is Rising 
Yet Wages have be Stagnant .

The What

A Crown Corporation
Mandated to Build and Train and Pay
The workforce of tomorrow
By doing the work of today.

The Pay

A living wage
Starting at $30/hour
With opportunities to grow.

The How (the loop)

1. Join & Bootcamp (up to ~6–8 weeks): universal safety tickets, cultural safety, disaster response basics, then stream-specific intro modules.
2. Service & Learning (1 year): 30-hour weeks (paid) with a blend of field work and lab/class time. All training time is paid time.
3. Yearly Review & Pathways: stay and loop back in by advancing as Core staff, switch streams, take an SCC tuition voucher into public post-secondary or trades, or move into external work (with SaskJobs support).
4. Reservist Option: after the year, opt into a paid emergency reservist pool for wildfire, flood, and other declared events.
