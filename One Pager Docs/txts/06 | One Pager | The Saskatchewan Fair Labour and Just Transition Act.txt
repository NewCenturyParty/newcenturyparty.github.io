The Saskatchewan Fair Labour & Just Transition Act

The Goal: To deliver decent pay and predictable hours, protect workers from abuse, and build the public capacity Saskatchewan needs—so people can move into resilient, future-proof work when they are ready.  

Worker Bill of Rights | Part II

The Institutions 

Saskatchewan Jobs (SaskJobs) | Part IV

SaskJobs is a modern, active labour-market service that meets people where they are. It offers no-wrong-door intake, dedicated Career Navigators with capped caseloads, and wraparound supports like safety tickets, checks, gear, childcare, and transport. Candidates can use training vouchers; employers can access targeted wage subsidies, retention bonuses, and relocation grants. A public Employer Quality Scoreboard gates all subsidies so public money only supports quality jobs.

Saskatchewan Century Corps (SCC) | Part V

The SCC is a Crown employer that provides paid, on-the-job training and real work in priority sectors—care, infrastructure, environment, digital, logistics, and agri/aquaculture. All training time is paid, and each year of honourable service earns a tuition voucher. The Corps also maintains an emergency reservist cadre and coordinates closely with SaskJobs, apprenticeship systems, and Indigenous partners under FPIC.

Saskatchewan Co-operative Development Agency (SCDA) | Part VI

SCDA is the one-stop co-op shop: navigators, legal/governance templates, shared back-office services, and neutral finance brokering. A universal Right-of-First-Refusal means when any Saskatchewan business is sold or closed, employees receive a disclosure pack, an exclusive bid window, and a match right to buy and convert to a co-op. SCDA will not incubate fossil-fuel co-ops and instead steers proponents to clean-economy models.

Saskatchewan Manufacturing Corporation (SMC) | Part VII

SMC is a Crown manufacturer that licenses, builds, and staffs world-class factories to make what Saskatchewan needs—starting with industrialized housing (built to Century Codes), then heat-pump/hydronic systems, solar PV, and batteries. A binding Green Manufacturing Duty requires renewably powered plants on a set schedule, near-zero embodied-carbon materials, ISO-certified environmental/energy management, lifecycle disclosures, ethical supply chains, and continuous improvement—without undercutting qualified private bidders.

Fair Work Authority (FWA) | Part II

The FWA is an independent inspectorate that enforces the Worker Bill of Rights. It has powers to enter workplaces, compel records, issue compliance orders and administrative penalties, debar bad actors, and publish a public non-compliance registry. The FWA also administers payroll credits (e.g., sick-day cost sharing), runs a worker/employer hotline, and coordinates with SaskJobs, the SCC, and the Just Transition Office to keep standards high across the system.

Highlights

Indigenous Consent
FPIC baked in wherever rights/lands/waters may be affected.

Transparency and Dashboards

Published metrics on: outputs, safety, credentials, placements, costs, and climate metrics, published routinely.

Timelines

Day 1: $25 minimum wage + indexation; FWA established in law; SaskJobs/SCDA interim functions begin.
Within 6–12 months: FWA fully operational; scheduling/30-hour standard phased in (public first, then private); EQS dashboard live; JTO launched.
12–24 months: SCC and SMC stood up by proclamation; modular-housing factory licensed/commissioned; co-op Right-of-First-Refusal regime in force.


Bottom line: higher floors, saner hours, faster job pathways, public capacity to build—and a fair, voluntary bridge for workers moving into the next Century of Saskatchewan.
