### Ending the Housing Crisis - Immediate 

- Immediate Day One Order In Council mandating a Rent Freeze for residential tenancies for no less than five years, and a small business rent freeze for two years.  
- New builds exempt if rent is no more than average local rent cost as determined by rent registry. 
- "A bridge to the law" 
	- a day one draft Bill (THIS BILL????) made to enact the freeze by legislature. (The idea being by OIC we stop any raises from happening immediately, and then our first thing we do is legislate the freeze into law) 
	- Landlords will be allowed to make repairs and the government will subsidize them 


### Rental Rights

- Housing First Solution 
	- Houseless People and those escaping domestic abuse will be given first priority to the newly rebuilt housing stock.
- Municipality Permitting
	- Province hereby declares Priority Housing Zones throughout the province (all urban cores, transit corridors, hospital / college districts) throughout the province. Not just Regina and Saskatoon. Its a problem everywhere. 
	- Within these Priority Housing Zones (PHZ) SHC social housing, non market housing, non-profit housing, co-op housing, are by right.

	- Permit Clocks

			- Site plan / zoning in < 21 days.
			- Building permit in in 30-45 days (larger projects in 60)
		- Is deemed approved if no notice of code defect is issued within those timeframes. 
	- Appeals
		- Limited only to code issues (life-safety, objective standards.******MUST DEFINE THESE STANDARDS *******) No discretionary design review. 
	- Accelerator Fund
		- Provide grants for things like water/sewage, roads, and operating top ups only if municipalities meeting certain goals like:
			- Housing start targets

			- zoning capacity (single family zoning must be abolished)
	- Minister may issue Provincial Housing Orders should municipalities fail to meet targets and timelines.
