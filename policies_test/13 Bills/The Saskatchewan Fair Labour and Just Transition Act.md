- Employment termination can only be for just cause. 
- Equal Pay for Equal Work
	- Temp employees, contract employees, part time employees, or full time employees must be given full, unabated benefits and equal pay. There can be no restriction of benefits offered to employees, and payrolls must be deducted accordingly. See [[The Saskatchewan Financial Sovereignty Act]] for payroll information regarding new Health coverages. 
	- Pay rates / scales must be made public and displayed on job boards.

	- Start with back office staff, NOT FRONT FACING.
	- Increase staffing BEFORE changing hours. 
	- Keep the same operating hours but split into two shifts that allow time for handover.

- Transition toolkits and conversion kits will be sent to public and private institutions to help with the transition. 
- Start off with a few ministries, and expand from there. 
- Funds set aside to help with the transition to help hire more workers, increase pay to match hours lost, etc.
