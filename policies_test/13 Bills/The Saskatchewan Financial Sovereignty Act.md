### Same-Business Groups

- Same-Business Groups are taxed as one business, meaning their incomes are combined for the purposes of the above taxation brackets. 
- Where multiple businesses are under common control, those corporations constitute a Same-Business Group. 
- Corporations under common control operating in distinct industries with separate staff, branding, premises, affiliations, are not a Same-Business Group. 
- Qualifications to be considered a Same-Business Group
	- Same 4 Digit NAICS
	- Shared Branding/website/phone/advertising or common loyalty program
	- Shared premises or equipment
	- Mostly shared employees/management 
	- Selling mostly to each other (>25% of revenue intra-group)
	- Centralized pricing, booking, POS, back office. 
- If you own multiple businesses but they are distinct with separate premises, staff, branding they are not a Same-Business Group





### Resource Royalties 

- Completely redesigned to be simple and transparent and increased. 
- There will be a higher base rate and a variable windfall rate that is tied to the commodity's market price, so when they are super profitable, Saskatchewan residents get a cut.
- The royalties will be split and deposited in two:
	- The General Revenue Fund: 
		-  Amount equal to five year rolling average in a given year. 
	- The Saskatchewan Dignity Fund
		- Anything above five year rolling average in a given year.
- An additional fixed percentage (say 2%) shall be added on to all resource royalties to fund [[Saskatchewan Reconciliation Fund (SRF)]]
