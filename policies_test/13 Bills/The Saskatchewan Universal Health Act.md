### Notes:

- Must define "medically necessary" and do so in plain english as well. 
	- My idea is medically necessary is whatever your clinician says it is, not what the government says it is. But that could be a problem so maybe not lmao
- Must define clawback prevention
	- Specific investigator and office to look into that as their primary objective?
