### Main Idea:

A simple monthly benefit for anyone making under $75,000 in Saskatchewan.

---

### Easy Application

- Any individual Saskatchewan resident over the age of 18 years old. 
- The only requirement, aside from being below threshold, is to submit your Application (only once) Direct Deposit info and the prior year's Notice of Assessment. 
- Every following year the individual will be required to submit the prior years Income Tax Return. 
- You may request an mid year change to benefit should you lose your job or have significantly reduced income from your job. No overpayments 

### Replacing SIS

- SIS is a means tested hellhole that barely pays anything, let alone enough to help people. As such it needs to be scrapped entirely and rebuilt to be the Saskatchewan Dignity Dividend 

### Tax Free

- The SDD is a tax free, refundable credit, payable monthly. 
- These are not taxable by law and this no T-Slips. 
- The SDD shall not be considered income for any provincial program whatsoever. 

### No Claw Backs

- Explicitly states there shall be no clawbacks in benefits
- SDD is inalienable and exempt from attachment, execution, or seizure. 
- Should an individual start making more money they will not be responsible for overpayments. Basically the benefit is only based on the prior year's tax information. Therefore the increase will show up in the following tax year's information and at that point the benefit will change. 

### Income

> Considered Income = Total Income (Line 23600) - Excluded Government Benefits (Lines 11300, 14500, 14600) - other excluded amounts (Self/Farm/Fish net incomes)
 
##### Considered  
- Earned income from employment (wages/salaries), taxable tips
- Net self employment income

### Notes:

- 15k benefit with a BRR of 0.20 making the max threshold 75k.
- Will have to adjust other benefits to align with BRR.
