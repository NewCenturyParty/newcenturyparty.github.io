### Main Idea:

*(Explain the idea in your own words, as if you were explaining it to a friend. How does it work? Why is it important? What are its implications? This is where you do your thinking.)*



--- 
### Notes:

- This is the main message of the [[New Century Party (NCP)]] for Saskatchewan. "We do it ourselves." Just like with SaskTel, we did it ourselves. We dont need to wait for the future to be built here, we will build it ourselves! 
- We need to make a better future for ourselves, by ourselves.
