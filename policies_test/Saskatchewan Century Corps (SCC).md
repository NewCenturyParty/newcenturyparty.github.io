*(Explain the idea in your own words, as if you were explaining it to a friend. How does it work? Why is it important? What are its implications? This is where you do your thinking.)*

### Tuition Voucher

- One year of honourable service will earn you one [[Tuition Voucher]] which will cover the cost of one full academic year (two terms, 5 classes per term, plus books and fees, and bus pass) at any Public University or Trade School in Saskatchewan. 
- [[Tuition Voucher]]s will have no expiration date
- [[Tuition Voucher]]s cannot be transferred. 
- [[Tuition Voucher]]s can be used to pay off existing student loan debt, federal or provincial. 
- 
### Union 

- Every member of the Sask Corps must join the union. Either a new union specifically for the SCC or just the SGEU. 

### Partnership with [[Saskatchewan Co-operative Development Agency (SCDA)]] 

- Train Sask Corp members to build and run a business / co-op during their training / work.
- Goal of having SaskCorp members eventually make their own businesses if they so choose. 


--- 
### Notes:

- Public Option for employ for things the province needs doing
- Might just limit it to environment, care, infrastructure, and maybe agriculture, for now. All of them must be trained for disaster response though. 
- One Year of Service = One Tuition Voucher
