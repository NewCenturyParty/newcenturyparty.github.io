                    <p>The NCP is a new political movement for Saskatchewan, built on a simple, powerful idea: <strong><u>we must meet this moment, together.</u></strong></p>

                    <p>For generations, Saskatchewan has lived by a simple motto: <strong><u>We do it ourselves.</u></strong> We didn't wait to be profitable enough. We built public options, from healthcare to education, power to heating, communications to insurance, to ensure everyone has access to the services they deserve.</p>

                    <p>Our platform for a <strong><u>21st Century Saskatchewan</u></strong> continues this tradition. It is a detailed blueprint made of 13 bills, developed in the open for all to see. We don't have all the answers, and there is no doing this alone. We invite you to read the plans, challenge our ideas, and help us build a future of hope and prosperity for all.</p>
