                    <p>The NCP is a new political movement for Saskatchewan, built on a simple, powerful idea: <strong><u>we must meet this moment, together.</u></strong></p>

                    <p>For generations, Saskatchewan has lived by a simple motto: <strong><u>We do it ourselves.</u></strong> We didn't wait to be profitable enough. We built public options, from healthcare to education, power to heating, communications to insurance, to ensure everyone has access to the services they deserve.</p>

                    <p>Our platform of <strong><u>21 Policies for the 21st Century Saskatchewan</u></strong> continues this tradition. It is a detailed blueprint, developed in the open for all to see. We don't have all the answers, and there is no doing this alone. We invite you to read the plans, challenge our ideas, and help us build a future of hope and prosperity for all.</p>

                        <p>The SDD is a simple monthly benefit for any resident earning under $100,000 annually.</p>
                        <p>It starts at $1667/month for those earning $0 annually and is reduced only by 20 cents for every dollar earned. That means that work always pays better, but it no longer controls your dignity.</p>
