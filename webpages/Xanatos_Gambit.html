                    <p>The Consent Protocol is not a tool to be used by the NCP &mdash; it is a genuine commitment to shared governance that happens to also create the most powerful legal and political shield imaginable.</p>
                    <p>The policies create real, material benefits for Indigenous communities: revenue sharing, job creation, co-ownership of resources, capacity funding, veto power over projects on their lands. If the partnership works &mdash; and we believe it will, because the deal is genuinely good &mdash; then the legal and political protections follow naturally.</p>
