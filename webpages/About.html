                <div class="section-copy">
                    <p>For too long, the people of Saskatchewan have been told a story about the future. A story where the best you can do is hang on. Where the goal is not to thrive, but to survive. Where the headlines are always about what is being cut, what is being lost, and what we cannot afford.</p>
                    <p>The New Century Party was founded because we believe Saskatchewan deserves a better story. One where the future is not something to be endured. It is something to be built. Together. With purpose. With ambition. With dignity at the centre of everything.</p>
                    <p>We are not here to manage decline. We are here to build a province that works for everyone who calls it home.</p>

                    <p>For a generation, politics has repeated the same script: cut services, sell assets, trust the market, and accept that some people will be left behind. The NCP rejects that completely.</p>
                    <p class="about-hero__lede">There is always an alternative when you have the courage to look for one and the will to build it.</p>
                    <p>Saskatchewan is resource-rich and people-rich. The problem has never been scarcity. The problem has been political imagination and the willingness to make our collective wealth serve the people who live here.</p>
