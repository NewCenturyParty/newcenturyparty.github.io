Human rights and safety: Nothing in this Act limits rights or remedies under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code, occupational health and safety legislation, or workers’ compensation statutes. 
Collective bargaining preserved: Nothing in this Act limits the right to organize, certify, bargain collectively or strike in accordance with the law.
