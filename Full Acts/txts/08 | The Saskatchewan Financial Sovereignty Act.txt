The purposes of this Act are to:
(a) secure Saskatchewan’s long-term financial sovereignty and stability;

(c) establish an arm’s-length Saskatchewan Sovereignty Fund with ring-fenced sub-funds for the Dignity Dividend, resilience/transition, and reconciliation;
(d) deliver a permanent, additive Saskatchewan Dignity Dividend that reduces income volatility without penalizing work;
(e) create a public, prudentially sound Saskatchewan Financial Group to expand inclusive, climate-aligned finance;
(f) modernize royalty, dividend, and windfall policies to stabilize the General Revenue Fund and save windfalls;
(g) maintain fair Marginal Effective Tax Rates (METRs) through coordinated tax/benefit design; and
(h) ensure transparency, accountability, and the protection of privacy in administering this Act.

1-3 Guiding principles

All persons exercising powers under this Act shall be guided by:
(a) Intergenerational equity — safeguarding real wealth for current and future residents;
(b) Stability and prudence — conservative liquidity for obligations and prudent-investor standards;
(c) Additivity — the Dignity Dividend is additive and should not claw back or displace other core supports unless expressly authorized by law;
(d) Transparency and accountability — timely public dashboards, audited reports, and intelligible disclosures;
(e) Indigenous partnership — co-development and consent for measures financed by the Reconciliation Fund, consistent with Aboriginal and Treaty rights;
(f) Climate alignment — investment and financing consistent with a timely transition to a low-carbon economy;
(g) Competitiveness and fairness — predictable rules that attract productive investment while ensuring a fair public share of rents;
