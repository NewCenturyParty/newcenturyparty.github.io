(b) ensure insured services are publicly administered, with direct billing to the public plan and no extra-billing;
(c) create arm’s-length Benefit Councils to recommend coverage rules, clinical indications, fee guides, and formularies based on clinical evidence, equity, and prudent stewardship;
(d) finance extended benefits through a Universal Health Levy set within actuarial corridors by an independent rates body;
(e) provide transparent dashboards of access, quality, safety, cost, and equity; and
(f) express the Legislature’s intent to amalgamate extended benefits with physician and hospital services into a single universal health service in Saskatchewan, on a timeline to be proposed to the Assembly under this Act.
